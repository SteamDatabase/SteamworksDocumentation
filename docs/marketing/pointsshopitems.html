<strong>WHY SHOULD I CREATE ITEMS FOR THE POINTS SHOP?</strong><br />
The Steam Points Shop represents a new way for fans to show off art from your game in their profile,
friends list, and chat. Points Shop items come from partners like you, and are a great way to
increase the visibility of your game. So far, millions of players have exchanged Steam Points for
these animated, game-themed collectibles.<br />

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="gameprofile"></a><strong>Game Profiles</strong></h2>
<h4>
    A Game Profile is a bundle of profile items that are themed together. It includes a new unique
    animated avatar, avatar frame, animated mini-profile background and an animated profile
    background. In addition to these assets, you will also need to customize the theme of the
    profile by entering 5 RGBA colors that make up different sections of the profile. These colors
    should compliment your art, but must not interfere with the legibility of the profile itself.
    Game profiles are great to theme around updates or new DLCs and you can have multiple per game.
    If you are coordinating your Game Profile with a Steam event, you can optionally prevent the
    item from appearing on the Point Shop until the event has started using the "Available From"
    time field on the item.

Displayed to users from their inventory, when they go to select the Game Profile to equip and from
the Points Shop. This asset is a logo that summarizes the entire Game Profile Bundle. It should
feature your game's identifying logo art, but does not need to include the text of your game's
name.<br />

    <a name="startupmovies"></a><strong>Steam Deck &amp; Big Picture Startup Movies</strong>
</h2>
<h4>
    Startup Movies are short videos that play when Steam Deck starts or (optionally) wakes from
    sleep. Startup movies also play in Big Picture mode on desktop. They contain both sound and
    video.

    alt="deck_startup_example_sm.gif"
    title="deck_startup_example_sm.gif"
/>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="8"></a>Video Guidelines</h2>
Startup movies need to be 1920x1200px in size for fullscreen display on Steam Deck. They should be
made with consideration for the fact that they will be cropped to 1920x1080px on most displays in
Big Picture mode. <br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>They should be between 3-10 seconds in length. <br /></li>
    <li>
        May include your game's logo but no other text or marketing material is permitted. <br />

        shape into your video is not required but is certainly permitted and encouraged (the more
        creative the better!). <br />
    </li>
    <li>Final file needs to be in .webm and .mp4 format and no larger than 5mb.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="9"></a>Audio Guidelines</h2>
All startup movies contain audio as well as video. Audio should be designed to complement the small
Steam Deck speakers output and not too loud that it overwhelms the user on startup. <br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>Audio files should be in a 16-bit 48kHz format.<br /></li>
    <li>Final output should be -12 dB peak and -14 LUFS average volume.<br /></li>
    <li>Avoid too many mid-low frequencies and consider a HPF starting around 40-80Hz.<br /></li>
    <li>
        Consider adding fades at the start and finish of the audio file to avoid any click or hard
        cut at the end of the startup video.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="10"></a>Asset Checklist</h2>
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>1920 x 1200px .webm (full-size movie / with sound) &lt; 5mb<br /></li>
    <li>1920 x 1200px .mp4 (full size movie / with sound) &lt; 5mb<br /></li>
    <li>320 x 220px .webm (small preview movie / no sound) &lt; 1mb<br /></li>
    <li>320 x 220px .mp4 (small preview movie for iOS / no sound) &lt; 1mb<br /></li>

Please remember that, under the Steam Distribution Agreement, all marketing materials you provide
need to be non-infringing. So be sure to clear any necessary rights for Valve to display and
distribute the startup movies via Steam.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="11"></a><strong>FAQ</strong></h2>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="12"></a>Rules and Guidelines</h2>
To ensure your Points Shop items are approved, here are some potential pitfalls to avoid:<br />
<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>Do not use screenshots or images not tailored to the space.<br /></li>
    <li>Do not include game logos in the backgrounds.<br /></li>
    <li>Do not use footage that strobes or flashes (for epilepsy accessibility).<br /></li>
    <li>Use dark imagery that blends into black.<br /></li>
    <li>
        Use the full image space, images behind the profile content may be toned down, but should
        not be removed.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Assets must be all-ages appropriate, as they are not age-gated. Regardless of what is
        included in-game, assets should not include nudity or adult content, or realistic gore.
        Valve will provide feedback on potentially inappropriate content.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="13"></a>Adult Content</h2>
Points Shop assets must be globally all-ages appropriate, as they are not age-gated. Regardless of
what is included in-game, assets should not include adult content or realistic gore. Adult content
includes:<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>Partial or full nudity<br /></li>
    <li>Sexually suggestive situations<br /></li>
    <li>Young-looking characters in risqué outfits or situations<br /></li>
    <li>Upskirt or upshirt imagery<br /></li>
    <li>
        Imagery where the central focus is sexually suggestive (ex: an image of a bra or panties).
    </li>
</ul>
<br />
Valve will provide feedback on potentially inappropriate content.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="14"></a>Review process</h2>
Once all your assets are uploaded, click the edit link beneath “Release State” to mark your assets
as ready for review. Once set as ready for review, your art assets will automatically appear in our
queue to review by Valve. This process typically takes 2-3 days and any necessary feedback will be
provided to you via the tool.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="15"></a>Releasing Points Shop Items</h2>
After your assets are approved, you'll see the status update on your Steamworks home page. You’ll
then be able to set the release state to “Released” and publish the items.<br />
<br />
NOTE: Once the assets are published changes are only permitted for errors.
<h2 class="bb_subsection">
    <a name="16"></a>Can I control when my items will go live on the Point Shop?
</h2>
Yes, you can set the time available field on any point shop item to control when it will appear in
the shop. This date/time is in UTC. You can use this option to coordinate your item's release with
an event or game update. This gives you the freedom to publish the items at any time and they will
become visible automatically at the time entered. Note that this time field cannot be changed once
you publish your approved items.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="17"></a>How many items can I upload per item type?</h2>
You can upload a maximum of 10 items per item type. Please note that items cannot be deleted once
they are published.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="18"></a>Helpful Links</h2>
For templates and visual specs please refer to the Community Items under the Community tab page for
your Steamworks app admin page. From an app page select "Edit Steamworks Settings" under the
Technical Tools section, then under the "Community" tab select "Community Items (e.g. Trading
Cards)". You'll find the relevant information here.
