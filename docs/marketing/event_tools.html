        <h5>In Brief</h5>
        You can make posts or schedule events to communicate with your players about news,
        live-events, or updates happening in your game. These posts are surfaced to players
        throughout Steam.
        <h5>Level of integration</h5>
        No game integration required. Complexity of posts can vary from simple text to richly
        formatted with images, videos, and tables.

We've been hard at work expanding Steam’s Events and Announcements system to enable integrated,
eye-catching communications with your players. In the course of developing, launching, updating, and
operating your game, you probably have interesting news to share, or moments you want players to be
a part of. To that end, we’ve enriched your outreach tools, providing a centralized place to
describe events about your game, and enhanced how those events can be surfaced to your audience.

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="getting_started"></a>Getting Started</h2>
Before you post an event or announcement, make sure the account you're going to post from meets the
criteria below. Also, keep in mind that the account posting will be shown as the author, along with
any public-facing parts of that profile (e.g., avatar, name, comments).<br />
<br />
<ul>
    <li>
        Make sure the account is a member of your publisher group with partner access to the product
        in question. More information on how to set up users and privileges can be found
        <a href="/doc/gettingstarted/managing_users" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a>.
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Alternatively, admins and officers of the product's associated Steam Community hub are
        allowed to post announcements by default. Group permissions can also be changed to control
        who can post announcements.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        You'll need to make sure that your individual Steam account is not 'limited'. If your own
        account is limited, you won't be able to create community groups or request to join an
        existing group. Click
        <a
            href="https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=3330-IAGK-7663"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noreferrer"
            >here</a
        >
        for details on limited accounts.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="visibility"></a>Event Visibility</h2>
<img
    src="https://cdn.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/event_example_store_armello.jpg"
    alt="event_example_store_armello.jpg"
    title="event_example_store_armello.jpg"
/><br />
<br />
Depending on the type of announcement you create, it will be visible through the following
channels:<br />
<br />
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Store page</strong> - The last two announcements tied to a product are featured
        below the associated DLC section on the product's store page.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Community hub</strong> - From the associated community hub, announcements will be
        featured in the main feed, as well as exclusively from the <i>News</i> tab. <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Steam Library detail page</strong> - With the new Steam Library, your game's
        improved Library page will show the recent events and announcements you've posted.
        Additionally, you can provide a spotlight image to visually call out the event on your
        page.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Steam Library home page</strong> - Also as part of the Steam Library update, your
        events and announcements can surface at the top of your players' Library homepage.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Activity feed</strong> - All users who are following a product will receive its
        announcements in their activity feeds.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Workshop hub</strong> - Tagging an announcement as 'Workshop' will cause it to show
        on your product's workshop hub.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>RSS feed</strong> - Steam automatically generate an RSS feed for each game, which
        you can use to post announcements to your own site, social media, or elsewhere. The URL
        format looks like this:
        <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/489830/rss" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
            >https://steamcommunity.com/games/489830/rss</a
        >
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="1"></a>Featured Event</h2>
On the "Visibility" tab for your event, you can also choose to enable "Special featuring for big
events". When enabled: This event will be temporarily featured above the activity section for each
user. This should only be used for major events, with adequate time between events so an event is
not always featured on your game details page.<br />
<br />
<img
    src="https://cdn.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/Events_FeaturedEventExample.png"
    alt="Events_FeaturedEventExample.png"
    title="Events_FeaturedEventExample.png"
/>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="2"></a>Creating New Events</h2>
To create a new event or announcement, you can follow the same paths you're accustomed to:<br />
<ul>
    <li>
        From your app landing page in Steamworks, click your Hub Admin panel: <br />
        <br />
        <img
            src="https://cdn.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/post_announcement_1.JPG"
            alt="post_announcement_1.JPG"
            title="post_announcement_1.JPG"
        />
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="categorization"></a>Categorization</h2>
To create a new event, you'll first be asked to select a category and sub-category. This is
important for a few reasons:<br />
<br />
<ul>
    <li>
        This categorization will not only impact <strong>where and how</strong> the event shows up,
        but also help players understand the event’s<strong> functional context</strong>. Not every
        type of event needs to be presented in the same way to players, so we’ve designed the system
        to accommodate everything from small patch notes to the biggest update of the year. <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Some types of events (such as livestreams or in-game discounts) have end dates, so selecting
        that type of event will allow you to specify when the promotion ends, and prompt the event
        to stop appearing.
    </li>
</ul>
<br />
We know that many events will fall into multiple categories at the same time. Just try to pick the
category that best matches the primary elements of your event.<br />
<br />
To help understand the impact different categories have on where and how an event appears, you'll
see a preview of the event's visibility when you mouse over each sub-category.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="3"></a>Editor</h2>
Once you've picked a category, you'll find a robust set of tools to create and customize your event.
This includes a new type of header image at the top of your event (which gets used in a few other
places), and a snappy preview mode that lets you quickly switch between editing and previewing your
event detail page.<br />
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Upload and embed images</strong> - You can upload images to be hosted on our
        servers, or you can link to images you have hosted elsewhere. JPGs, PNGs, and animated GIFs
        are the formats to use. Images included in the body of your event will appear as max of
        800px wide.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Embed YouTube videos</strong> - You can insert one or more YouTube videos and
        specify how you'd like them to be presented on the page.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Automatic link widgets</strong> - When you include a link to specific websites, the
        page will automatically turn them into a preview of that link. Valid links include:<br />
        <ul>
            <li>YouTube videos<br /></li>
            <li>
                Steam Workshop files or other shared files on Steam such as screenshots, guides, or
                artwork<br />
            </li>
            <li>Twitter posts<br /></li>
            <li>Links to another game's Steam store page</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Rich text formatting options</strong> - Section headers, tables, and lists are
        always solid choices.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Start and End Dates</strong> - You'll notice that some events have both a start and
        end date. This allows us to properly archive certain kinds of events after their time has
        elapsed. For example, if you post an event about a limited-time offer for in-game items, you
        would want that event to be archived once your promotion is over so players aren't confused
        or dissatisfied when they assume the promotion is still happening. <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Staging events ahead of time</strong> - You'll notice visibility settings that allow
        you to stage an event in advance, and not have it appear until the date of the event arrives
        (or some other specific date you want it to appear).<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>HTML importing</strong> - If you prefer to use HTML, or have an existing HTML
        version of an announcement, you can use the HTML import option. This will convert your
        existing document to use bbcode, which is supported by our announcement system.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="4"></a>Saving drafts</h2>
While you are preparing an event, you can hit 'Save' any time at the bottom of the event editor to
save your work in progress. This is saved as a draft until you go through the 'Publish' steps to
make your event live on Steam.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="5"></a>Localization</h2>
Events and Announcements supports full localization of all text fields and images. You can provide
translated versions of your post and images, and Steam will display the right version to each user
based on their language. If a particular language is not provided, Steam will fall back to showing
the English version to that player.<br />
<br />
Your complete set of localizations can be uploaded via CSV for streamlined importing. Please see the
CSV export options at the top of each event for proper formatting. If you have special symbols that
are included in your text (ie- ™) then save your file as CSV-UTF8 format before you import. That
should enable the special symbols to import correctly.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="6"></a>Publishing</h2>
Once you are happy with your event page, you can hit the big 'Publish' button to make your event
publicly visible. This will allow the event to start showing up to players based on the visibility
settings you have chosen. It can appear immediately to make an upcoming event visible to players, or
only when the event begins, or on a specific date you want it to become visible.<br />
<br />
<strong>Note</strong>: there may be a delay of an hour before your event appears within the Steam
Library, as our moderation team reviews posts for proper categorization and mature content. For more
info, please see
<a href="/doc/marketing/event_tools/moderation">Events and Announcements Review Step</a>
documentation.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="editing"></a>Editing an Event</h2>
You can make edits to your event at any time if you need to adjust the contents. Note that once you
have published an event, any subsequent changes you save may appear immediately to players (still
dependent on visibility settings you specified).<br />
<br />
Some things to note:<br />
<ul>
    <li>
        Start dates - We have a few rules around start dates to ensure notifications and visibility
        don’t conflict and create logical contradictions in the code:<br />
        <ul>
            <li>You cannot publish an event with the start time set in the past.<br /></li>
            <li>
                You cannot move a start time that has already passed, as this would cause multiple
                notifications that may annoy Steam users.<br />
            </li>
            <li>
                We don't use the start time of an event to determine whether a user has seen the
                event in various places on Steam, rather we use the first time the event is visible
                as the post-time. This post-time will be used by Steam algorithms to determine
                whether a Steam customer has "seen" the event or not.<br />
            </li>
            <li>
                Moving the start time of an event might confuse customers, as calendar entries a
                player manually creates or downloads may become out-of-sync with the actual event.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        End dates - you can always edit the end date on an active event to end it immediately, or
        conversely, extend the event.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="7"></a>Deleting an Event</h2>
In a worst-case scenario, you can delete an event. The delete button is in the upper-right corner of
the blue bar you see while editing an event.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="8"></a>Developer Usage Rules</h2>
Events and announcements are powerful tools to reach players in your community in new ways. There
are a few scenarios where we don’t see customer benefit from using events and announcements.<br />
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Using inappropriate content</strong> - Content in the event should be appropriate
        relative to the settings for your product. In other words, if your product is marketed as
        all-ages, don't include sexual or violent content in the announcement. Furthermore, all
        announcement assets should be safe for work.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Promoting unrelated products</strong> - If an event or announcement is primarily
        about a product other than the one you are posting from, you should make sure it is marked
        as a Cross Promotion.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Promoting other versions of the product</strong> - Events and announcements about
        other versions of your product should only be made when the product is similar in
        functionality to the Steam version (eg. no advertising a better version that is available
        elsewhere). In all cases, these should be tagged as Cross Promotions, unless that other
        version of the product makes the Steam version better (eg. release of cross platform saves
        between multiple versions of your product).<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Miscategorizing events</strong> - In general, you should pay close attention to the
        category selection when creating an event/announcement. This setting controls visibility to
        ensure that the correct audience is seeing the content they would expect.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="9"></a>Best Practices</h2>
Announcements are a powerful tool to communicate with anyone using your product. They can also help
you reach new players. Like any tool, following best practices will help you get the most out of
it.<br />
<br />
<a href="/doc/marketing/event_tools/event_examples">Click here</a> to see examples of how events and
announcements appear in the Steam store, community, and library.<br />
<br />
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Have a goal</strong><br />
        Having a clear goal in mind will help you to create meaningful and important announcements,
        and inform your measurement of their effectiveness. Take time to consider whether an
        announcement is the best way to accomplish your goal. For example, if the goal of an
        announcement is to reduce player confusion over an in-game feature, try instead to address
        the root of the confusion in-game. <br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Listen to your players</strong><br />
        Listen to your community and organize all of their feedback before communicating. Consider
        how different player types will interpret your announcements. Pay close attention to what
        elements of your announcements create interest and quality feedback, so that you can repeat
        those elements in future posts.<br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Treat announcements as an extension of your product</strong><br />
        So you've decided to create a product for public consumption. As such, respect and
        prioritize how you<i> talk about</i> your game as highly as the nuts-and-bolts programming.
        Communications deserve the same creative energy as in-game design. Work collaboratively when
        writing announcements - everyone working on the product should have input into what you are
        communicating to players. <br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Pair announcements with updates</strong><br />
        Product updates are a prime use case for announcements. If you are posting an announcement
        about one of your bigger game updates, you can also use an
        <a href="/doc/marketing/visibility" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
            >Update Visibility Round</a
        >.<br />

        <strong>Reward your players</strong><br />
        Your team is constantly listening to players - use that to your advantage by rewarding fans
        and generating further interest. Some rewards to keep in mind:<br />
        <ul>
            <li>Highlighting fan art and screenshots submitted by your fans.<br /></li>
            <li>Referencing your community's memes.<br /></li>
            <li>
                Teasing future content (this is also a great way to generate feedback and excitement
                before you actually work on the update).
            </li>

        <strong>Balance outreach like you'd balance your game</strong><br />
        When announcements are used properly, players anticipate hearing about your product. Part of
        this anticipation is created by having an exciting product, but communicating selectively
        also plays an important role. <br />
        <br />
        It may be tempting to post a lot of announcements and be involved in every discussion. If
        you don't have a reason to post an announcement, don't post one - constant communication
        just to fill space risks player fatigue. Instead, take a step back and listen. <br />
