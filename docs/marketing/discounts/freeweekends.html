<h1>Free Weekends</h1>
A <strong>Free Weekend</strong> is a time-limited promotion that allows players to temporarily
access and play an eligible game for free—typically over a long four-day weekend.<br />
<br />
Unlike a <a href="/doc//store/application/demos">Demo</a>, which offers a separate demo build of
your game via a separate demo app ID, Free Weekends grant players full access to your base game via
its current app ID, albeit for a limited time. Free Weekends also differ from
<a href="/doc/store/freetoplay">Free to Play games</a>, which are always available at no cost.
<br />
<br />
Free Weekends might not make sense for your game. Read on for more details.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Overview</h2>
Setting up a Free Weekend requires Valve approval. <br />
<br />
By default, Free Weekends are not promoted anywhere on the Store, aside from your game’s own store
page. For this reason, Free Weekends are typically combined with other kinds of curated discounts,
which are promoted to customers on Steam, for example a <strong>Daily Deal</strong>,
<strong>Midweek Deal</strong> or <strong>Weekend Deal</strong>. While there aren't exact rules, as a
base guideline we tend to focus on the most-played or best-selling games on Steam for these kinds of
promotions. Please see <a href="/doc//marketing/discounts#14">Curated Discounts</a> for details.<br />
<br />
Not all games will be a good fit for a Free Weekend. Keep in mind that players have a wide range of
free-to-play games and free demos available on Steam every day, so temporarily offering a paid game
for free doesn't guarantee interest from customers. In general, Free Weekends tend to perform best
for games with lots of replayable content or games with strong multiplayer elements that benefit
from an influx of new players (such as improved matchmaking or enhanced social gameplay).<br />

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="2"></a>How It Works</h2>
During a Free Weekend, a free package temporarily appears on your base game's store page, alongside
its standard 'paid' package.<br />
<br />
This free package uses the same <a href="/doc//store/application">App ID</a> and
<a href="/doc//store/application/depots">Depots</a> as your base game, and includes a callout to
show players how much time remains in the event.<br />
<br />
Once the Free Weekend ends, the free package is automatically removed from your store page. Players
who participated will still see your game listed in their Steam libraries, but they’ll only be able
to uninstall it - continued play requires purchasing the full version.<br />
<br />

    alt="FreeWeekend_Packages.jpg"
    title="FreeWeekend_Packages.jpg"
/>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="3"></a>Timing</h2>
<br />
Free Weekends typically run from <strong>Thursday at 10 AM Pacific</strong> to
<strong>Monday at 10 AM Pacific</strong>. However, any discount on the paid version of your game can
extend beyond the Free Weekend itself. If you're planning to pair your Free Weekend with a Daily
Deal, we recommend choosing a Thursday, Friday, or Saturday start date to align with the Free
Weekend schedule.<br />
<br />
We suggest running your Free Weekend for at least four days to ensure players have enough time to
download and meaningfully engage with your game. Keep in mind Steam's global audience will be
downloading your game through a wide variety of internet speeds and data plans, which can represent
a significant investment for some players, especially for games with larger file sizes.<br />
<br />
Please also note that Steam may spread out Free Weekend events on the calendar to avoid overlapping
promotions.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="4"></a>Setup</h2>
To run a Free Weekend, you'll first need approval from the Steam Team as described in the
<a href="/doc/marketing/discounts/freeweekends#1">Overview</a> above. <br />
<br />
If approved, here are few set up steps and best practices:
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="5"></a>Steam Team Setup:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        The Steam Team will create a special Free Weekend package that grants players access to your
        game during the event. From your app's main landing page, you can find this package by
        navigating to: All Associated Packages &gt; Free Weekend Packages.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Steam will automatically handle activation and deactivation of this Free Weekend package,
        ensuring it goes live at the start of the Free Weekend and is deactivated and removed from
        your game's Store Page when the event ends.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="6"></a>Your Setup:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        After the Free Weekend package is staged, you'll need to republish your store page at any
        time before the event begins. This won’t make the Free Weekend visible to customers ahead of
        time, but it will enable the package to display on your Store Page when the event starts.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Use the
        <a href="/promotion/discounts/dashboard" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
            >Discount Management Tool</a
        >
        to schedule any discounts you'd like to offer alongside your Free Weekend. Note: a discount
        is required if your Free Weekend is running alongside a Daily Deal, Midweek Deal, or Weekend
        Deal.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="7"></a>Best Practices:</h2>
To make the most of your Free Weekend, we recommend the following:
<ul>
    <li>
        Pair your Free Weekend with a compelling discount on your paid package to encourage
        conversions. <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Extend your discount a few days beyond the end of the Free Weekend to give players extra
        time to upgrade after trying the game.<br />
    </li>
    <li>Ensure your game servers are ready for a temporary influx of new players.<br /></li>
    <li>
        If you're messaging your Free Weekend off of Steam, consider pointing those communications
        at your base game's Store Page and using
        <a href="/doc//marketing/utm_analytics">UTM analytics</a> to measure the impact.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        To help message your Free Weekend on Steam, consider:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Creating a <a href="/doc//marketing/event_tools">News Event</a> to let your current
                players know about the Free Weekend and that they can invite their Friend's to play
                for free while it's active. <br />
            </li>
            <li>
                Setting up a temporary
                <a href="/doc/store/assets/overrides">Artwork Override</a> about your Free Weekend.
                Be sure to align the override’s start and end times with the Free Weekend dates.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="8"></a>Performance</h2>
After the event, you can review participation, conversion rates, and other key metrics in the Free
Weekend section of your Steamworks Dashboard by appending your app ID to the following URL: <br />
<br />
<a href="https://partner.steampowered.com/freeweekend/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
    >https://partner.steampowered.com/freeweekend/</a
>
&lt;--Your App ID Here<br />
<br />
Keep in mind that not all benefits of a Free Weekend will be immediately measurable --for example
the community benefit to a potential increase in the player base, or all the people who buy the game
simply because it's on sale or being played by friends at the moment, regardless of the Free Weekend
offer. In general, Free Weekends can give more players the opportunity to experience your game
firsthand, even if they never intend to buy it. Longer term, this can lead to increased familiarity,
awareness and discussion of your game—even after the event ends.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="9"></a>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<ul>
    <h4>Can I gate access or limit content for Free Weekend players?</h4>
    <strong>A: </strong
    >There is a specific WebAPI call in the ISteamApps interface —
    <a href="/doc/api/ISteamApps#BIsSubscribedFromFreeWeekend" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
        >BIsSubscribedFromFreeWeekend</a
    >
    — to help you identify whether or not a player is accessing your game via a Free Weekend
    package. You can use this call to limit or adjust access. For instance, if you have concerns
    around cheating or negatively impacting your existing playerbase, you may wish to make certain
    modes unavailable, or exclude Free Weekend players from ranked matchmaking. It is not required
    to use this API, but the option is there if you think it is appropriate for your game.
    <h4>Can Free Weekend players leave a review on my game?</h4>
    <strong>A: </strong
    >Yes, they can leave a review but it will be categorized as a non-Steam purchase. So the review
    is readable by other players, but not factored into your game's review score unless the user
    buys the game.
    <h4>How often can I run a Free Weekend?</h4>
    <strong>A:</strong>
    Eligible games can run a Free Weekend once per calendar year.
    <h4>Do Free Weekend players get trading card drops?</h4>
    <strong>A: </strong
    >No. Trading cards will not drop for a player unless they have purchased the game on Steam or
    activated a key for the game.
