<h1>Daily Deals</h1>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Overview</h2>
Daily Deals are a curated promotion on Steam, offered to games that fit the criteria described
below. Games selected as Daily Deals are featured on the Steam homepage, applicable tag and genre
pages. <br />

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="2"></a>Daily Deal Eligibility</h2>
Since Daily Deals appear prominently in the Steam Store and are visible to broad swaths of
customers, we need to have confidence that these offers will be interesting to a broad set of
customers. Therefore, we judge eligibility for daily deals based on demonstrated customer interest
or trending momentum in revenue over the past few months. <br />
<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        <strong>Revenue</strong> - The threshold shifts over time based on how many games are
        demonstrating strong revenue, but typically the games that qualify sustainably reach tens of
        thousands of dollars in revenue per month. If your game has released within the last 2-3
        months, it's too soon to evaluate it for a daily deal. <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Discount</strong> - This eligibility also assumes that the game is ready to run a
        compelling discount, and may be adjusted if there are other factors in play such as a
        planned major update, a new discount depth, a launch of a DLC, or the release of the game
        into 1.0.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Once a year maximum</strong> - All forms of curated promotions are limited to
        roughly once a year so that other games have an opportunity.
    </li>
</ul>

If you think this roughly describes your game, please feel free to

and ask about running a Daily Deal for your game.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="3"></a>Visibility &amp; Duration</h2>
Two or more Daily Deals are displayed on the front page of Steam and may also be featured on
appropriate tag pages (RPG, Simulation, VR, etc). From the set of active Daily Deals, Steam will
prioritize which ones are surfaced first to each user depending on each players' play history and
selected language. <br />
<br />
Daily Deal discounts can be between 7 and 14 days in duration, depending on what you choose when
scheduling. See
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc//marketing/discounts/dailydeal#5" class="bb_doclink"
    >Self-Schedule (Beta)</a
>
below for details on scheduling.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="4"></a>Asset Used</h2>
Daily Deals use the same
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/assets/standard#header_capsule" class="bb_doclink"
    >header capsule</a
>
that appears on your game's store page in the upper-right corner.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="5"></a>Self-Schedule (Beta)</h2>
The ability for a developer/publisher to schedule their Daily Deal on the calendar is now in beta.
If a game has been determined that it is eligible for a Daily Deal, Valve will send an invite to
contacts for that game that have
<a

and

    href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/gettingstarted/managing_users"
    target="_blank"
    rel="noreferrer"
    >Manage Pricing &amp; Discounts</a
>
permissions.<br />
<br />
The Daily Deal invite will expire 30 days after being sent, regardless if it was read. Upon
receiving the invite, partners can then go to the Daily Deal calendar and choose a day (within the
next 6 months) to schedule their Daily Deal. After the day is chosen, a discount event will
automatically be created if a discount is not already scheduled for the selected day. The discount
does not need to begin on the same date as the daily deal. For the Daily Deal to go live a discount
must be entered.<br />
<br />
A status of the Daily Deal will be shown in the
<a
    href="https://partner.steamgames.com/promotion/dailydeals/dashboard/"
    target="_blank"
    rel="noreferrer"
    >Daily Deal Management</a
>
page.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="6"></a>How Does This Work?</h2>
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>Select an available date within the next 6 months that works for you.<br /></li>
    <li>
        The visibility on the Steam homepage and applicable tag pages runs for 24 hours, while the
        discount will be active for between 7 and 14 days depending on the discount length you
        selected. It will start at 10am Pacific time on your selected date.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        When you select an available date, it will prompt you to enter a discount percentage and
        select which packages you wish to include in the promotion.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        We ask that you pick a discount % that is at least as good as the best discount you have run
        in the past, if not better.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        If you are not ready to schedule your Daily Deal right now, the invite will be on your Daily
        Deal Dashboard. Please keep the expiration date in mind.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="7"></a>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<h4>Q: What discount should I run for my Daily Deal?</h4>
A: The Daily Deal is meant to be special and for a short window. Because of this, we recommend going
with the largest discount that you have run to-date, or at a minimum, matching your best discount.
You also shouldn't feel obligated to continue raising your discount after this special promotion.
It's fine to step back down to a lower discount percentage during your next sale.
<h4>Q: This will be the first discount/promotion for my game. What discount should I run?</h4>
A: If this is your first discount, it's totally fine to go within the range of 15 to 25% for this
deal. Keep in mind that a discount of 20%+ will also trigger Steam wishlist notifications, which can
help boost additional visibility.
<h4>Q: How can I maximize the success of my Daily Deal?</h4>
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        <strong>Time with an update.</strong> Pairing a Daily Deal feature with a content update or
        a special event can be very effective. The Daily Deal feature displays your game's Header
        Capsule image, so you can also temporarily switch it out using
        <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/assets/overrides" class="bb_doclink"
            >Artwork Overrides</a
        >
        to shine some additional light on your new update or event. Also, don't forget to activate
        an update visibility round to support the content update of the game, if applicable.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Stream to your store page. </strong> Livestreaming is a good way to drive engagement
        and showcase your game. Take advantage of the increased traffic by showcasing your game with
        a live broadcast. You can read instructions here:

        ><a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/" class="bb_doclink"><br /> </a>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Make an announcement.</strong> This can be about the event or the new game content
        update. Not really related to the Daily Deal, but definitely something you can do to further
        elevate the deal. Read more about
