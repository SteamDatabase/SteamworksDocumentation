<h1>Seasonal Sales</h1>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Overview</h2>
Four times a year, we run Steam-wide seasonal sale events. The seasonal sales are open to all
released games (see FAQ) on Steam and joining is not prevented by being on discount cooldown nor
does it create a discount cooldown. You can enter your discount for each via the
<a href="/promotion/discounts/dashboard/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
    >Discount Management page</a
>.<br />
<br />
Every game on Steam can join a seasonal sale and any discount set to 20% or greater will
automatically trigger email notifications to players with your game on their wishlist. Discounted
titles are eligible to appear in various 'specials' sections throughout Steam, based on your game's
tags, popularity of your game, and to users that it is recommended.<br />
<br />
The seasonal sales take over the Steam store experience in a big way, redesigning the front page to
thematically show off the sale. A selection of titles will be shown on the front page in different
areas and our recommendation engine will sort the featuring. The front page will refresh the options
regularly throughout the sale to display fresh games for customers who are browsing often. The goal
is to get every featured title a chance to maximize their visibility for the entirety of the sale,
and not just a 24-hour period (which is what the featuring used to be) and to make it easy for
customers to find the great games and great deals.

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="3"></a>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<h4>
    Q: Can I participate in Steam-wide seasonal sale events if my product recently launched or had a
    price increase?
</h4>
A: Generally, you cannot submit a discount within 30 days of release or a price increase in any
currency. See Price Introduction Cooldowns in the
<a href="/doc/marketing/discounts#21">Discount Rules</a> for details. However, if your 30-day Price
Introduction Cooldown ends during a seasonal sale, you could choose to join the sale already in
progress by manually entering a custom discount once your cooldown ends (i.e., 30 days or more from
your release date or price increase).<br />
<br />
In any case, there are always future opportunities to put your game on discount, so you shouldn't
feel pressured to change your release date or pricing updates for the sake of a seasonal sale event.
<h4>Q: I increased my price in the last 30 days for one or more currencies, can I discount?</h4>
A: No, products cannot be discounted for 30 days after any currency price increase, within 30 days
of release or 30 days from when the launch discount ends. For more information on pricing, see our
<a href="/docadmin/edit/store/pricing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">documentation here</a
