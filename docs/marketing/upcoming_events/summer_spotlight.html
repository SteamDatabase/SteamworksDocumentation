<h1>Steam's Summer Showcase of Summer Showcases</h1>
Steam's hub for the summer showcase events (e.g. Summer Game Fest, PC Gaming Show, Xbox Showcase)
happening around the weekend of Summer Game Fest. In this hub, players will find links and
highlighted games from each of the participating showcase landing pages.<br />
<br />
Likely around June 10-17; Final dates to be announced once Summer Game Fest is scheduled.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Updated for 2026</h2>
This hub on Steam will be primarily a list of each of the participating events, along with a
carousel of top wishlisted games from that event, and a clickable banner leading players to that
event page.<br />
<br />
Each individual event page is built and managed by the organizers of that event, and can host a
livestream and lists of the announced games.<br />
<br />
Steam's hub page itself will not be hosting the livestreams.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="2"></a>Important Dates</h2>
These are the important milestones we need to hit along the way<br />
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>March 15, 2026 - Do you intend to participate with an event?</strong> We need to
        know. You'll need to fill out the Submission Form at the bottom of our information and rules
        page. Get started here:
        <a href="/doc/store/promo/organizers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
            >https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/promo/organizers</a
        ><br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>May 15, 2026 - Does your livestream work?</strong> Make sure you've tested the

        <strong>June 1, 2025 - Has your event page been submitted for review? </strong>Make sure you
        give us enough time to review your event page and approve it for publishing<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Early June - Kick Off!</strong> - The show kicks off with the first livestream.
        Valve will send out a press announcement about our Summer Showcase hub page. Hub landing
        page will become visible, showing the schedule of livestreams and grid of participating
        events.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="3"></a>How to Participate</h2>
This Summer Showcase is built around the idea of multiple events that are each showcasing a set of
new game announcements or updates, unveiled via livestream. To qualify as part of the Steam Summer
Showcase, each participating event must be running a livestream at some point with major new
announcements.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="4"></a>Event Organizer Requirements</h2>
To participate, each event must provide Steam with the following<br />
<br />
<ul>
    <li>
        Let us know that you want to participate by carefully reading the rules and filling out the
        submission form linked at the bottom of the page here:
        <a href="/doc/store/promo/organizers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
            >https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/promo/organizers</a
        >.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        The Steam promo team will help enable the landing page editor tools, and will send you an
        asset request with templates and requirements for the assets we need to be able to host and
        promote your event fully.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Once the landing page editor tools have been enabled, you'll need to configure your landing
        page on Steam, adding your event info, background image, logo, and sections for the
        announced games.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        You need to complete the asset request form by the noted deadline, sending us a layered copy
        of artwork you use on Steam for your event page, including any non-standard fonts.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        You also need to submit your landing page itself for review by the deadline noted above so
        that our promo team can make sure everything looks configured correctly.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="5"></a>Create a landing page on Steam</h2>
Each participating event will have a landing page where you'll be livestreaming and showcasing the
games that are being announced. To get started creating this page, please visit
<a href="/doc/store/promo/organizers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
    >https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/promo/organizers</a
>, read the rules, and click the link at the bottom to get started building your page. When you fill
out the form, make sure to include the fact that this is part of "Summer Showcases".<br />
<br />
This landing page should have clear branding and description of who is organizing the event, what
the event is, and specific dates and times that players would be most interested in (such as any
unveiling livestream, or new game playthroughs, etc.)
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="6"></a>Layered Artwork and Font Files</h2>
We'll be translating many of the promo materials into the standard set of 26 supported languages on
Steam, so we need your layered files to make sure we can include your event in this process. Here is
what we need:<br />
<ul>
    <li>
        A layered Photoshop (PSD) file that includes your event logo (smart object preferred)
        separated from the art. Any text should be editable in a separate “text” folder within the
        PSD document, so that it may be easily localized by our team.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Please send us these layered files for any of the banners and images you are including on
        your sale page and livestream event. This includes Cover Image, Sale Page Background Image,
        Store Page Banners, and any images you include on your sale page that contain text.<br />
    </li>
    <li>Please also include any non-standard fonts used</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="7"></a>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<strong>Q. What if I'm not ready to set my landing page live by the announcement date?</strong
><br />
A. Your event will not appear until you have set your landing page visible. You can set your landing
page to be visible, even if the start date of the event is in the future.
