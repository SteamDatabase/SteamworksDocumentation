<h1>Steam's Summer Showcase of Summer Showcases</h1>
There are several events happening this summer around the same timeframe, so we're putting together
a Summer Showcase landing page on Steam and will be promoting it on the homepage of Steam. On that
landing page, players will find a schedule of the major event livestreams that are taking place
during this timeframe along with links to each of the major announcement events. Players will be
able to watch the current active livestream as well as click through to each of the landing pages
for more information and details.<br />
<br />
This hub on Steam is made up of three parts:<br />
<ol>
    <li>
        A grid of banners, each representing an event that is part of the summer showcase (e.g.
        Summer Game Fest, PC Gaming Show, Xbox Showcase)<br />
    </li>
    <li>A schedule of major livestreams from each of those events<br /></li>
    <li>A video player showing the current scheduled livestream</li>
</ol>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Important Dates</h2>
These are the important milestones we need to hit along the way<br />
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>May 31st</strong> - All livestream events must be created and sent to Valve to be
        added to the schedule. Your landing page must be complete and sent to Valve so we have time
        to translate any text present on the page.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>June 6th, Kick Off!</strong> - The show kicks off with the first livestream. Valve
        will send out a press announcement about our Summer Showcase hub page. Hub landing page will
        become visible, showing the schedule of livestreams and grid of participating events.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="2"></a>How to Participate</h2>
This Summer Showcase is built around the idea of livestream events that contain major new
announcements. Whether that is announcing new games for the first time or major updates to existing
games. Each participating event must be running a livestream at some point with major new
announcements.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="3"></a>Event Organizer Requirements</h2>
To participate, each event must provide Steam with the following<br />
<br />
<ul>
    <li>Create a landing page on Steam<br /></li>
    <li>Create a scheduled livestream type event<br /></li>
    <li>Send us layered copy of artwork used on Steam, including any non-standard fonts</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="4"></a>Create a landing page on Steam</h2>
Each participating event will have a landing page where you'll be livestreaming and showcasing the
games that are being announced. To get started creating this page, please visit
<a href="/doc/store/promo/showcase_page" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
    >https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/promo/showcase_page</a
>, read the rules, and click the link at the bottom to get started building your page. When you fill
out the form, make sure to include the fact that this is part of "Summer Showcases".<br />
<br />
This landing page should have clear branding and description of who is organizing the event, what
the event is, and specific dates and times that players would be most interested in (such as any
unveiling livestream, or new game playthroughs, etc.)
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="5"></a>Create a scheduled livestream type event</h2>
Under the same Steam Community Group as your sale landing page, you can create and schedule "Live
Stream" type events, which will be used on our event schedule. Tell us about each of those that you
create, and we'll add them to the event schedule that appears on our Summer Showcase landing
page.<br />
<br />
<ol>
    <li>Create a new event/announcement<br /></li>
    <li>Select type "Broadcast/Live Stream"<br /></li>
    <li>Fill in the title and description for that event. <br /></li>
    <li>
        Switch to the 'Broadcasting' tab in the event and enable broadcasting. In the area called
        "Broadcast Allow List", add the Steam account that will be doing the livestreaming.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Due to how our schedule tech works, you should schedule one event for each hour block of
        time that you intend to have a major livestream taking place. So, if your most major
        livestream event is actually three hours long, please create three separate livestream type
        events with sequential start and end times. Each should be set to start and end on the hour
        (eg. "10:00am" not "10:30am")<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Use your support ticket from creating your landing page, or contact us via email to tell our
        operations team the list of livestream events you want to appear on our schedule and we'll
        get that in place.
    </li>
</ol>
For more details on setting up and running a livestream, please see
<a href="/doc/store/broadcast">Livestreaming</a>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="6"></a>Layered Artwork and Font Files</h2>
We'll be translating many of the promo materials into the standard set of 26 supported languages on
Steam, so we need your layered files to make sure we can include your event in this process. Here is
what we need:<br />
<ul>
    <li>
        A layered Photoshop (PSD) file that includes your event logo (smart object preferred)
        separated from the art. Any text should be editable in a separate “text” folder within the
        PSD document, so that it may be easily localized by our team.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Please send us these layered files for any of the banners and images you are including on
        your sale page and livestream event. This includes Cover Image, Sale Page Background Image,
        Store Page Banners, and any images you include on your sale page that contain text.<br />
    </li>
    <li>Please also include any non-standard fonts used</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="7"></a>Post Event Recap</h2>
Once all the major announcement events have taken place, we'll launch another landing page that will
include all games listed on any of these event pages. This is to help player explore the full set of
exciting games that are being announced for the first time or updated so they can add them to their
wishlist or simply learn more about them.<br />
<br />
This landing page will also have links back to the event landing page that you set up, so you
probably would want to update that landing page to replace the livestream widget with an embedded
YouTube video for players that missed your livestream<br />
<ul>
    <li>
        Disable livestreaming on your page by clicking 'off' on the broadcast tab in your sale page
        editor<br />
    </li>
    <li>Add a new section to your sale page and select type "Text"<br /></li>
    <li>
        Click the YouTube icon just above the text field and enter your YouTube URL. Select "Full
        Width" for best results and move that section to the top of your page.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="8"></a>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<strong>Q. What if I'm not ready to set my landing page live by the announcement date?</strong
><br />
A. That's fine. We can still represent your event in the grid of participants, even if it doesn't
click through to anywhere until a later date.
