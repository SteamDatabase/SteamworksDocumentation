    <li>
        <strong>January 8, 2026</strong> - The trailer announcing the event launches on this day. At
        this point, you're welcome to share your participation in the event. Assets for this purpose
        will be available in the <a href="#asset">Asset Kit</a> below.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>January 12, 2026 @ 10:00am PDT</strong> - The event starts. This is the deadline for
        entering a discount, and opting out if you no longer want to participate.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="eligibility"></a>Eligibility</h2>
Eligible games will feature one or more mysteries that serve as the primary focus or gameplay loop
of the game.<br />
<br />
These games are likely to include:<br />
<ul>
    <li>Clues to be 'found' or deduced via mini-game or puzzle<br /></li>
    <li>
        Some kind of deduction process - it's not enough to solve each mini-game or only gather the
        clues, the player must 'put it together' in the end somehow.<br />
    </li>
    <li>A notebook where the player can review the clues they've gained so far<br /></li>
    <li>
        Multiple ways of acquiring clues - interviewing suspects/witnesses, taking a closer look at
        specific parts of the crime scene, etc.
    </li>
</ul>
<br />
Eligible games will be easily identifiable as a detective game first and foremost - games that
feature a big mystery but the player is not actively solving for it are not eligible. <br />
<br />
Types of genres that might disqualify a game:<br />
<ul>
    <li>
        Police games - detectives on the police force are fine, but if the game focuses on things
        like patrolling, making arrests, assigning tickets, and shootouts, it may not be a fit<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Social deduction games - if there is no 'big mystery' and it's a round-based title, then
        that's not eligible<br />
    </li>
    <li>Hidden Object games - there's a separate Hidden Object Fest for these titles<br /></li>
    <li>Strong gameplay elements from a different genre - like shooting, platforming, or racing</li>
</ul>
<br />
As an example, a shooting game where the main character is being targeted by a mysterious
person/group would not be eligible if the game mostly focuses on shooting rather than
mystery-solving.<br />

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="asset"></a>Asset Kit</h2>
Weâ€™ve created an asset kit of images and templates for you to use on your own social media channels
when telling your fans about your participation in this event. These assets are designed to work
well on various platforms and you're welcome to use them to let players know you'll be
participating. Our official event trailer will typically launch around 4 days prior to the event; we
recommend the same timing for utilizing these assets to promote your participation on your own
channels. (please reference <a href="#dates">Important Dates</a> above).<br />

waiting until the event trailer is live (again, roughly 4 days prior to the event) as a more
effective communications beat with your audience.<br />
