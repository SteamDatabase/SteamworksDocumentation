<h1>Steam 4X Fest 2025</h1>
<img src="" /><br />
<br />
4X Fest welcomes games that have all four Xs - Explore, Expand, Exploit, and Exterminate.<br />
<br />
In general, titles eligible for 4X Fest are all about building empires - which means there's a heavy
PvP or PvE focus, where you're fighting against something to come up as the strongest. You likely
have some form of diplomacy in game, the ability to make minute adjustments to your economy, and
have enough subsystems to make a new player's head spin. Nearly all grand strategy games will be
eligible.<br />
<br />
This event runs August 11 at 10:00 AM PDT (-07:00) to August 18 at 10:00 AM PDT (-07:00) and will
include eligible titles with sections for discounted titles, unreleased titles in Coming Soon mode,
games with demos, and more.<br />

Weâ€™ve created an asset kit of images and templates for you to use on your own social media channels
when telling your fans about your participation in this event. These assets are designed to work
well on various platforms and you're welcome to use them to let players know you'll be
participating. Our official event trailer will typically launch around 4 days prior to the event; we

        Follow the link in the invitation email, or click this link to see your eligible games and
        register each:
        <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/optin/sale/4X_2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"

        ><br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Once a game is registered, you can then enter discounts on the Discount Management page:

    </li>
</ol>
<br />
<strong>Q. Will there be livestreaming as part of this event?</strong><br />

game's store page as you wish.<br />
<br />
<strong>Q. I've changed my plans. How do I cancel my registration?</strong><br />
A. Just return to the registration page for your game by inserting your appID at the end of this URL

    target="_blank"

>
and deselect the checkbox at the very bottom of the page to remove your game from the event.<br />
<br />
<strong
    >Q. Can I promote our participation in the event on our own channels before the trailer goes
    live?</strong
><br />
A. Technically yes; you can publish once the Asset Kit is available for download, but we recommend
waiting until the event trailer is live (again, roughly 4 days prior to the event) as a more
effective communications beat with your audience.<br />
