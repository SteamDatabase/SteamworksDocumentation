<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>June 8</strong> - The trailer announcing the event launches on this day. At this
        point, you're welcome to share your participation in the event. Assets for this purpose will
        be available in the <a href="#asset">Asset Kit</a> below.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>June 8 @ 10:00am PST</strong> - The event starts. This is the deadline for entering
        a discount, and opting out if you no longer want to participate.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="eligibility"></a>Eligibility</h2>
Eligible titles will generally fall into one of two categories:<br />
<ul>
    <li>
        Bullet Hells (you must dodge many bullets coming towards you, typically from a 2D or
        top-down perspective)<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Reverse Bullet Hells / Bullet Heavens / Survivor-likes (you are the source of the bullets,
        and are mowing down hordes of enemies with your projectiles)
    </li>
</ul>
<br />
Your average shooter game will not be eligible for this Fest. There needs to be a sense of
'overwhelmingness' - either caused by the number of projectiles your character unit is shooting out,
or by the number of projectiles you need to dodge. Games where you must aim and reload are generally
not going to be good fits.<br />
<br />
Most first-person games are not going to be a good fit. Platformers and Metroidvanias are also
generally ineligible, unless a high on-screen bullet count is part of gameplay.<br />
<br />
Games that include some elements of these titles, but only a small portion of combat, are not
eligible.<br />
<br />

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="asset"></a>Asset Kit</h2>
We’ve created an asset kit of images and templates for you to use on your own social media channels
when telling your fans about your participation in this event. These assets are designed to work
well on various platforms and you're welcome to use them to let players know you'll be
participating. Our official event trailer will typically launch around 4 days prior to the event; we
recommend the same timing for utilizing these assets to promote your participation on your own
channels. (please reference <a href="#dates">Important Dates</a> above).<br />

parent documentation page).<br />
<br />
<strong>Q. Do I need to register my game before entering a discount?</strong><br />
A. Yes, you need to do the following things in order:<br />
<ol>
    <li>
        Follow the link in the invitation email, or click this link to see your eligible games and
        register each:
        <a href="/optin/sale/bullet_2026" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"

    <li>
        Once a game is registered, you can then enter discounts on the Discount Management page:

            >https://partner.steamgames.com/promotion/discounts/dashboard/?15217</a
        >
    </li>
</ol>
<br />
<strong>Q. Will there be livestreaming as part of this event?</strong><br />
A. Livestreaming will not be featured on the sale page, but you're welcome to livestream on your own
game's store page as you wish.<br />
<br />
<strong>Q. I've changed my plans. How do I cancel my registration?</strong><br />
A. Just return to the registration page for your game by inserting your appID at the end of this URL
<a href="/optin/sale/bullet_2026/<appid>" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
    >https://partner.steamgames.com/optin/sale/bullet_2026/&lt;appid&gt;</a
>
and deselect the checkbox at the very bottom of the page to remove your game from the event.<br />
<br />
<strong
    >Q. Can I promote our participation in the event on our own channels before the trailer goes
    live?</strong
><br />
A. Technically yes; you can publish once the Asset Kit is available for download, but we recommend
waiting until the event trailer is live (again, roughly 4 days prior to the event) as a more
effective communications beat with your audience.<br />
