<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="eligibility"></a>Eligibility</h2>
Third-Person Shooter Games Fest are for games that are:<br />
<ol>
    <li>From the third-person perspective<br /></li>
    <li>Where the primary gameplay loop is shooting (bullets, water, cupcakes, etc.)</li>
</ol>
<br />
Games with strong elements of other genres (including racing, puzzles, platforming, and stealth) are
generally not eligible though it will depend on how much of the game is spent shooting vs. these
other activities. Additionally, games played in the third-person that include shooting but has
strong gameplay elements of other forms of combat (martial arts, swords, etc.) are not invited to
this event. <br />
<br />
Horror games where the shooting is to discourage enemies / temporary disable them to allow the
player character to run away, rather than completely dispatching them, are also not allowed.<br />
<br />
Games that participated in First Person Shooter Fest are not allowed. If your game has both POVs,
then the one that customers appear to play your game under is the one that your title is eligible
for. For unreleased titles, what is visible via your trailer and screenshots will be used to qualify
your title's POV.<br />
<br />
Additionally, tower defense titles (where you control a character that is also shooting) are not
allowed either.<br />
