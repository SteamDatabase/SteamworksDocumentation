work together in harmony, or a tense village constantly on the verge of collapse. <br />

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="asset"></a>Asset Kit</h2>
We’ve created an asset kit of images and templates for you to use on your own social media channels
when telling your fans about your participation in this event. These assets are designed to work
well on various platforms and you're welcome to use them to let players know you'll be
participating. Our official event trailer will typically launch around 4 days prior to the event; we
recommend the same timing for utilizing these assets to promote your participation on your own
channels. (please reference <a href="#dates">Important Dates</a> above).<br />

game's store page as you wish.<br />
<br />

A. Just return to the registration page for your game by inserting your appID at the end of this URL

    target="_blank"

<strong
    >Q. Can I promote our participation in the event on our own channels before the trailer goes
    live?</strong

A. Technically yes; you can publish once the Asset Kit is available for download, but we recommend
waiting until the event trailer is live (again, roughly 4 days prior to the event) as a more
effective communications beat with your audience.<br />
