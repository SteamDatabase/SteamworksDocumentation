<h1>Steam Automation Fest 2025</h1>
<img src="" /><br />
<br />
This Fest is for the games that have you thinking "hm, this belt is in the way of this other belt,
so I just need to move a few things around and then I'll shorten the time to build that thing..."
and then it's 2am and you haven't finished building.<br />
<br />
Automation Fest is for games that feature heavy automation as a primary gameplay loop. Does your
game feature multiple machines with an input and an output? Do you have teleporters,
conveyor/transport belts, tubes, robotic arms, lifts, or other objects that help goods move from one
side of your factory to another? The name of the game for these games is efficiency; eligible titles
will be focused around the idea of getting from input A to input B in the most efficient manner. The
idea of a production chain should be one that your game is familiar with.<br />
<br />
This event is not for games where you're optimizing things like crop yields for your population, or
trade routes so your kingdom can stay alive, or min-maxing gold bar creation in order to fund your
offers. It's fine for your game to have an end goal, but the primary gameplay loop should be about
optimizing for optimizations sake; no lives should be at stake!<br />
<br />
This event runs July 14 at 10:00 AM PDT (-07:00) to July 21 at 10:00 AM PDT (-07:00) and will
include eligible titles with sections for discounted titles, unreleased titles in Coming Soon mode,
games with demos, and more.<br />

        <strong>July 10, 2025</strong> - The trailer announcing the event launches on this day. At
        this point, you're welcome to share your participation in the event. Assets for this purpose
        will be available in the <a href="#asset">Asset Kit</a> below.<br />

    <li>
        <strong>July 14 at 10:00 AM PDT (-07:00)</strong> - The event starts. This is the deadline
        for entering a discount, and opting out if you no longer want to participate.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="eligibility"></a>Eligibility</h2>
Games where the automation comes from minions that mindlessly move things around are not eligible,
nor are games where your character gets better at creating objects. Puzzles that are solved by
creating efficient pathways to take an input and generate the desired output, or programming puzzles
where there are multiple solutions (and ways to improve your solution) are allowed.<br />
<br />
If you have to care about something other than if you have enough materials to create more things,
such as hunger, population, or ethics, then your title probably isn't a great fit. Similarly, if
your game has heavy shooting, this is probably not the Fest for you!<br />

effective communications beat with your audience.<br />
