        <strong>November 6, 2025</strong> - The trailer announcing the event launches on this day.
        At this point, you're welcome to share your participation in the event. Assets for this
        purpose will be available in the <a href="#asset">Asset Kit</a> below.<br />

        <strong>November 10 at 10:00 AM PST (-08:00)</strong> - The event starts. This is the
        deadline for entering a discount, and opting out if you no longer want to participate.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="eligibility"></a>Eligibility</h2>
The main character(s) must be animals; no animal sidekicks here, sorry! If your game is about a boy
and his dog, but you control the boy and not the dog, then sorry, this event is not for you.<br />
<br />
If your game is <i>about</i> animals in an important way - like a zoo simulator, a cat café
management game, or an animal rescue simulator, those are generally eligible. However, if you are a
puzzle game that features an animal mascot, your title is only eligible if the puzzle "pieces"
(whether that's a hidden object game, a sokoban title, or a organizational puzzle) are animals.<br />
<br />
No humanoid/humanized animals are eligible for this event - no catgirls, no bunnyboys, or any
variation thereof. Additionally, the animals must be real; the only exception to this are unicorns
(which are basically fancy rhinos, if you think about it), so dragons, phoenixes, griffins,
centaurs, and the like, do not qualify as "animals" for this event. Sorry.<br />
<br />
Farming Simulators are not eligible unless all of the NPCs/townsfolk are also animals. Merely having
animal husbandry is not enough to qualify a title for this Fest.<br />

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="asset"></a>Asset Kit</h2>
We’ve created an asset kit of images and templates for you to use on your own social media channels
when telling your fans about your participation in this event. These assets are designed to work
well on various platforms and you're welcome to use them to let players know you'll be
participating. Our official event trailer will typically launch around 4 days prior to the event; we
recommend the same timing for utilizing these assets to promote your participation on your own
channels. (please reference <a href="#dates">Important Dates</a> above).<br />

</ol>
<br />
<strong>Q. Will there be livestreaming as part of this event?</strong><br />
A. Livestreaming will not be featured on the sale page, but you're welcome to livestream on your own
game's store page as you wish.<br />
<br />
<strong>Q. I've changed my plans. How do I cancel my registration?</strong><br />
A. Just return to the registration page for your game by inserting your appID at the end of this URL
<a
    href="https://partner.steamgames.com/optin/sale/animal_2025/&lt;appid&gt;"
    target="_blank"
    rel="noreferrer"
    >https://partner.steamgames.com/optin/sale/animal_2025/&lt;appid&gt;</a
>
and deselect the checkbox at the very bottom of the page to remove your game from the event.<br />
<br />
<strong
    >Q. Can I promote our participation in the event on our own channels before the trailer goes
    live?</strong
><br />
A. Technically yes; you can publish once the Asset Kit is available for download, but we recommend
waiting until the event trailer is live (again, roughly 4 days prior to the event) as a more
effective communications beat with your audience.<br />
