Sports Fest celebrates all of the sportballs out there, including all sorts of sports that don't
involve spherical objects! Whether your game is about managing a team, playing the game itself, or
training a team to take on the Olympics - as long as it's mostly about sports, you're welcome to
join.<br />
<br />
This event runs December 8 @ 10:00am PDT to December 15 @ 10:00am PDT and will include eligible
titles with sections for discounted titles, unreleased titles in Coming Soon mode, games with demos,

<ul>
    <li>Managing a sports team<br /></li>
    <li>Playing a sport (either individual or teams)<br /></li>
    <li>Guiding a sport team to victory</li>
</ul>

Games that take place in a sports setting, but aren't about sports (for example visual novels or
puzzles) are not eligible for this event. Games featuring multiple sports are allowed, as are games
with fantasy versions of existing sports.<br />
<br />
Games that contain martial arts or parkour, but are not about the sport itself and instead lend
itself to gameplay mechanics like combat or platforming, are not eligible either.<br />
<br />
Games that are eligible for Racing Fest are not eligible for Sports Fest. For the purposes of this
event, we do not consider chess a sport. Sorry!<br />

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="asset"></a>Asset Kit</h2>
Weâ€™ve created an asset kit of images and templates for you to use on your own social media channels
when telling your fans about your participation in this event. These assets are designed to work
well on various platforms and you're welcome to use them to let players know you'll be
participating. Our official event trailer will typically launch around 4 days prior to the event; we
recommend the same timing for utilizing these assets to promote your participation on your own
channels. (please reference <a href="#dates">Important Dates</a> above).<br />

waiting until the event trailer is live (again, roughly 4 days prior to the event) as a more
effective communications beat with your audience.<br />
