Calling all seafaring explorers - this Fest is for games about the sea, whether above water or
below!<br />
<br />
Games eligible for this event will be set primarily on, in, or under a body of water colloquially
known as an 'ocean'. <br />
<br />
This event runs May 18 @ 10:00am PST to May 25 @ 10:00am PST and will include eligible titles with
sections for discounted titles, unreleased titles in Coming Soon mode, games with demos, and
more.<br />

    <li>
        <strong>May 14</strong> - The trailer announcing the event launches on this day. At this
        point, you're welcome to share your participation in the event. Assets for this purpose will
        be available in the <a href="#asset">Asset Kit</a> below.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>May 18 @ 10:00am PST</strong> - The event starts. This is the deadline for entering
        a discount, and opting out if you no longer want to participate.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="eligibility"></a>Eligibility</h2>
As the name implies, this event expects one thing: the ocean.<br />
<br />
Your game may include land, but a majority of the game should take place on or in an ocean. Lakes,
ponds, and other non-ocean bodies of water are not eligible.<br />
<br />
The method of travel is flexible: boats, scuba-diving, swimming, etc. are all eligible for this
event. You can also be a fish (or a shark) - no need for the player character to be human.<br />
<br />
The ocean must also be relevant to the story or gameplay; games that could conceivably take place
<i>not</i> in the ocean are not eligible.<br />
<br />
Aquarium titles are not allowed, sorry! Fishing is also not allowed unless the player travels across
the oceans in search of new fishing spots.<br />

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="asset"></a>Asset Kit</h2>
We’ve created an asset kit of images and templates for you to use on your own social media channels
when telling your fans about your participation in this event. These assets are designed to work
well on various platforms and you're welcome to use them to let players know you'll be
participating. Our official event trailer will typically launch around 4 days prior to the event; we
recommend the same timing for utilizing these assets to promote your participation on your own
channels. (please reference <a href="#dates">Important Dates</a> above).<br />

    >Steam Themed Sale Events</a

parent documentation page).<br />
<br />
<strong>Q. Do I need to register my game before entering a discount?</strong><br />
A. Yes, you need to do the following things in order:<br />
<ol>
    <li>
        Follow the link in the invitation email, or click this link to see your eligible games and
        register each:
        <a href="/optin/sale/ocean_2026" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
            >https://partner.steamgames.com/optin/sale/ocean_2026</a
        ><br />

    <li>
        Once a game is registered, you can then enter discounts on the Discount Management page:

            >https://partner.steamgames.com/promotion/discounts/dashboard/?14132</a
        >
    </li>
</ol>
<br />
<strong>Q. Will there be livestreaming as part of this event?</strong><br />
A. Livestreaming will not be featured on the sale page, but you're welcome to livestream on your own
game's store page as you wish.<br />
<br />
<strong>Q. I've changed my plans. How do I cancel my registration?</strong><br />
A. Just return to the registration page for your game by inserting your appID at the end of this URL
<a href="/optin/sale/ocean_2026/<appid>" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
    >https://partner.steamgames.com/optin/sale/ocean_2026/&lt;appid&gt;</a
>
and deselect the checkbox at the very bottom of the page to remove your game from the event.<br />
<br />
<strong
    >Q. Can I promote our participation in the event on our own channels before the trailer goes
    live?</strong
><br />
A. Technically yes; you can publish once the Asset Kit is available for download, but we recommend
waiting until the event trailer is live (again, roughly 4 days prior to the event) as a more
effective communications beat with your audience.<br />
