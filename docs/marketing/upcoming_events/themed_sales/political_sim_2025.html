<h1>Steam Political Sim Fest 2025</h1>
<img src="" /><br />
<br />
This Fest is for games where you get to guide a nation - to victory, to riches, or perhaps to ruin.
Political Sim Fest is for games about politicking - the kind where you, the leader of a nation,
navigate the tricky world of international politics while managing your nation at home.<br />
<br />
This event runs September 8 at 10:00 AM PDT (-07:00) to September 15 at 10:00 AM PDT (-07:00) and
will include eligible titles with sections for discounted titles, unreleased titles in Coming Soon
mode, games with demos, and more.<br />

        purpose will be available in the <a href="#asset">Asset Kit</a> below.<br />

        <strong>September 8 at 10:00 AM PDT (-07:00)</strong> - The event starts. This is the
        deadline for entering a discount, and opting out if you no longer want to participate.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="eligibility"></a>Eligibility</h2>
Games eligible for this Fest will include some combination of:<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>Factions (Party vs. Party, Military vs. Business, etc.)<br /></li>
    <li>Multiple options for ruling (democratic, autocratic, oligarchic, etc.)<br /></li>
    <li>Interest groups vying for attention/power<br /></li>
    <li>Some element of international diplomacy (eg. managing allies / enemies)</li>
</ul>
<br />
However, games that are primarily about warfare and games that were in 4X Fest are not eligible. If
your title is both a 4X title and a political sim, please pick the ones that your game aligns more
closely against.<br />
<br />
Aside from that, the following will render a game ineligible:<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        Significant portions of gameplay focusing on combat, city building, or other non-politicking
        affairs<br />
    </li>
    <li>Games where you play a god where you shape society indirectly / directly<br /></li>
    <li>
        Games where you play a Judge, a lowly government worker, or some other cog in the machine
        that is not the leader - games where you can be elected to a powerful position are
        eligible<br />
    </li>
    <li>Games featuring politicians, but are not political sims, are not eligible<br /></li>
    <li>
        Games about the impact of government (eg. Orwellian games, surveillance titles, parody
        titles, political commentary) are not eligible for this event
    </li>
</ul>
