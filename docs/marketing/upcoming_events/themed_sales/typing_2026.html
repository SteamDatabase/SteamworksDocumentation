These games are all about typing - quickly, accurately, and (sometimes) under a lot of pressure.<br />
<br />
This event runs February 5, 2026 @ 10:00am PDT to February 9, 2026 @ 10:00am PDT and will include
eligible titles with sections for discounted titles, unreleased titles in Coming Soon mode, games

    <li>
        <strong>February 2, 2026</strong> - The trailer announcing the event launches on this day.
        At this point, you're welcome to share your participation in the event. Assets for this
        purpose will be available in the <a href="#asset">Asset Kit</a> below.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>February 5, 2026 @ 10:00am PDT</strong> - The event starts. This is the deadline for
        entering a discount, and opting out if you no longer want to participate.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="eligibility"></a>Eligibility</h2>
Games eligible for this Fest will focus on typing as a mechanic, and the thing you should be typing
should be shown on screen.<br />
<br />
In general, games fall into a few categories:<br />
<ul>
    <li>Typing as combat<br /></li>
    <li>Typing to move your character</li>
</ul>
<br />
Merely having the ability to type in game does not make your game eligible. It needs to be a
significant part of gameplay. Games that are about words (building them, logic puzzles, anagrams,
etc.) are not eligible by default; gameplay needs to be around typing, specifically. If typing is a
vehicle for other types of gameplay, the game is likely not eligible.<br />
<br />
Hacking / programming-type games are not eligible.<br />
<br />

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="asset"></a>Asset Kit</h2>
Weâ€™ve created an asset kit of images and templates for you to use on your own social media channels
when telling your fans about your participation in this event. These assets are designed to work
well on various platforms and you're welcome to use them to let players know you'll be
participating. Our official event trailer will typically launch around 4 days prior to the event; we
recommend the same timing for utilizing these assets to promote your participation on your own
channels. (please reference <a href="#dates">Important Dates</a> above).<br />

parent documentation page).<br />
<br />
<strong>Q. Do I need to register my game before entering a discount?</strong><br />

<ol>
    <li>
        Follow the link in the invitation email, or click this link to see your eligible games and
        register each:
        <a href="/optin/sale/typing_2026" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"

        Once a game is registered, you can then enter discounts on the Discount Management page:

            >https://partner.steamgames.com/promotion/discounts/dashboard/?14032</a
        >
    </li>
</ol>
<br />
<strong>Q. Will there be livestreaming as part of this event?</strong><br />
A. Livestreaming will not be featured on the sale page, but you're welcome to livestream on your own
game's store page as you wish.<br />
<br />
<strong>Q. I've changed my plans. How do I cancel my registration?</strong><br />
A. Just return to the registration page for your game by inserting your appID at the end of this URL
<a href="/optin/sale/typing_2026/<appid>" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
    >https://partner.steamgames.com/optin/sale/typing_2026/&lt;appid&gt;</a
>
and deselect the checkbox at the very bottom of the page to remove your game from the event.<br />
<br />
<strong
    >Q. Can I promote our participation in the event on our own channels before the trailer goes
    live?</strong
><br />
A. Technically yes; you can publish once the Asset Kit is available for download, but we recommend
waiting until the event trailer is live (again, roughly 4 days prior to the event) as a more
effective communications beat with your audience.<br />
