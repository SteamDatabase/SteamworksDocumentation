<h1>Steam Medieval Fest 2026</h1>
<img src="" /><br />
<br />
Medieval Fest is all about games that takes place in medieval times! Now, we know that 'medieval' is
a bit fuzzy and there's no academic agreement on what it means, so for the sake of this Fest games
in the following settings will be considered 'Medieval':<br />
<ul>
    <li>Post-iron but pre-guns<br /></li>
    <li>
        Feudalism (ex. lords, nobles, emperors, daimyos, kings) are the primary political
        structure<br />
    </li>
    <li>The majority of the population are peasants<br /></li>
    <li>The weapons of choice are swords, bows, crossbows, and cannons (for siege purposes)</li>
</ul>
<br />
Games that take place in some vague pre-modern period but don't have the defining characteristics
listed above will not be eligible. For example, you should note that lace, telescopes, and banks are
all post-Middle Age developments. Some level of anachronism is fine, but medieval is more than just
"pre-electricity".<br />
<br />
This event runs April 20, 2026 @ 10:00am PST to April 27, 2026 @ 10:00am PST and will include
eligible titles with sections for discounted titles, unreleased titles in Coming Soon mode, games
with demos, and more.<br />

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="asset"></a>Asset Kit</h2>
We’ve created an asset kit of images and templates for you to use on your own social media channels
when telling your fans about your participation in this event. These assets are designed to work
well on various platforms and you're welcome to use them to let players know you'll be
