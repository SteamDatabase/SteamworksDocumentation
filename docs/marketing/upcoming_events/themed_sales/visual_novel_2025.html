<br />
Visual Novel Fest is for all those games that you could almost mistake for a book! From romance
stories to political intrigue, this Fest is for all sorts of text-based interactive fiction. If you
took away all of the words from these games, you’d probably have very little to do – but that’s
okay, because the beauty of these games are all in the storytelling. <br />
<br />
This event runs March 3 at 10:00 AM PST (-08:00) to March 10 at 10:00 AM PDT (-07:00) and will
include eligible titles with sections for discounted titles, unreleased titles in Coming Soon mode,
games with demos, and more.<br />

game's store page as you wish.<br />
<br />
<strong>Q. I've changed my plans. How do I cancel my registration?</strong><br />
A. Just return to the registration page for your game by inserting your appID at the end of this URL

    target="_blank"

<br />
<strong
    >Q. Can I promote our participation in the event on our own channels before the trailer goes
    live?</strong
><br />
A. Technically yes; you can publish once the Asset Kit is available for download, but we recommend
waiting until the event trailer is live (again, roughly 4 days prior to the event) as a more
effective communications beat with your audience.<br />
