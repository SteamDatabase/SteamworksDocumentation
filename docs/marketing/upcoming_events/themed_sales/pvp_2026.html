<br />
In past years we've celebrated Valentine's Day by featuring co-operative games you can play with
your loved ones.<br />
<br />
Not this year! This year we celebrate PvP games - that is, player versus player games where you
fight your friends and loved ones in combat. Whether it's online PvP or local split-screen
shenanigans, all games with combat PvP are welcome to join.<br />
<br />
This event runs February 9, 2026 @ 10:00am PST to February 16, 2026 @ 10:00am PST and will include
eligible titles with sections for discounted titles, unreleased titles in Coming Soon mode, games
with demos, and more.<br />

    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="eligibility"></a>Eligibility</h2>
Please note that this is called PvP Fest, and not 'online multiplayer Fest'. <br />
<br />
This means that your game <i>must</i> feature player versus player <u>combat</u>!<br />
<br />
The "Share/Split Screen PvP" or "Online PvP" feature should be selected for your title, and your
title should feature combat of some kind.<br />
<br />
Social Deduction games that feature the ability to kill or knock out other players are allowed.
Games where you beat your opponent by points are not allowed, sorry!<br />
<br />
For additional clarity: board/card game type of games are generally not eligible - this Fest is for
games where you fight your friends directly, and not through some other medium.<br />
<br />

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="asset"></a>Asset Kit</h2>
We’ve created an asset kit of images and templates for you to use on your own social media channels
when telling your fans about your participation in this event. These assets are designed to work
well on various platforms and you're welcome to use them to let players know you'll be
participating. Our official event trailer will typically launch around 4 days prior to the event; we
recommend the same timing for utilizing these assets to promote your participation on your own
channels. (please reference <a href="#dates">Important Dates</a> above).<br />

<ol>
    <li>
        Follow the link in the invitation email, or click this link to see your eligible games and
        register each:
        <a href="/optin/sale/pvp_2026" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"

            >https://partner.steamgames.com/promotion/discounts/dashboard/?13983</a
        >
    </li>
</ol>
<br />
<strong>Q. Will there be livestreaming as part of this event?</strong><br />
A. Livestreaming will not be featured on the sale page, but you're welcome to livestream on your own
game's store page as you wish.<br />
<br />
<strong>Q. I've changed my plans. How do I cancel my registration?</strong><br />

<br />
<strong
    >Q. Can I promote our participation in the event on our own channels before the trailer goes
    live?</strong
><br />
A. Technically yes; you can publish once the Asset Kit is available for download, but we recommend
waiting until the event trailer is live (again, roughly 4 days prior to the event) as a more
effective communications beat with your audience.<br />
