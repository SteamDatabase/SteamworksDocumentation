        <strong>May 12, 2025</strong> - The trailer announcing the event launches on this day. At
        this point, you're welcome to share your participation in the event. Assets for this purpose
        will be available in the <a href="#asset">Asset Kit</a> below.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>May 12 at 10:00 AM PDT (-07:00)</strong> - The event starts. This is the deadline
        for entering a discount, and opting out if you no longer want to participate.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="eligibility"></a>Eligibility</h2>
Eligible games will likely have the following elements:<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>The gameplay loop involves capturing/taming/growing these creatures<br /></li>
    <li>An album where you can check how many of the creatures you've captured<br /></li>
    <li>
        The creatures can be stored somewhere - either with the player, in a box, in a base, or
        something similar<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        These creatures should do something for the player post-capture; they should be able to
        fight, be played with, be displayed, etc.
    </li>
</ul>
<br />
The following features would make a game ineligible:<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>The creatures being collected are real animals (no zoo, aquarium titles)<br /></li>
    <li>The creatures being collected are non-sentient (plants, viruses, amoebas, etc.)<br /></li>
    <li>
        The creatures being collected are randomly generated (creatures must be unique and finite -
        there needs to be an 'end' to the collection)<br />
    </li>
    <li>Tamagotchis, or other games that focus on raising one creature at a time<br /></li>
    <li>Hunting games where the focus is hunting creatures, rather than collecting them<br /></li>
    <li>
        The creature collection is a mini-game or a small part of a different gameplay loop (ie.
        Farming Sims with creatures are generally not eligible)
    </li>
</ul>

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="asset"></a>Asset Kit</h2>
We’ve created an asset kit of images and templates for you to use on your own social media channels
when telling your fans about your participation in this event. These assets are designed to work
well on various platforms and you're welcome to use them to let players know you'll be
participating. Our official event trailer will typically launch around 4 days prior to the event; we
recommend the same timing for utilizing these assets to promote your participation on your own
channels. (please reference <a href="#dates">Important Dates</a> above).<br />

<br />

<br />
<strong
    >Q. Can I promote our participation in the event on our own channels before the trailer goes
    live?</strong

A. Technically yes; you can publish once the Asset Kit is available for download, but we recommend
waiting until the event trailer is live (again, roughly 4 days prior to the event) as a more
effective communications beat with your audience.<br />
