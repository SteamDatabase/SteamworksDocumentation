<br />
This Fest is for games featuring zombies or vampires… or both! Whether you play a vampire hunter
stalking Dracula’s children across the continent, or a nervous kid thrust into a zombie apocalypse,
this Fest is for all games featuring either of these undead monsters. <br />
<br />
This event runs May 26 @ 10:00am PDT to June 2 @ 10:00am PDT and will include eligible titles with
sections for discounted titles, unreleased titles in Coming Soon mode, games with demos, and
more.<br />

<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>May 26</strong> - The trailer announcing the event launches on this day. At this
        point, you're welcome to share your participation in the event. Assets for this purpose will
        be available in the <a href="#asset">Asset Kit</a> below.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>May 26 @ 10:00am PDT</strong> - The event starts. This is the deadline for entering
        a discount, and opting out if you no longer want to participate.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="eligibility"></a>Eligibility</h2>
Genres of all types are welcome, so long as the primary theme or character(s) are zombies or
vampires. Your zombies / vampires must be explicitly named as such or be easily identified as that
archetype. Your game should probably feature the zombie(s) or vampire(s) in the key art and in
screenshots. <br />
<br />
Games that happen to take place in Transylvania or in a post-apocalyptic world are not eligible
unless vampires and zombies happen to show up in a big way during the game. Zombies or vampires in
the background of your game, or as set dressing, is not enough for your title to be eligible if the
player does not interact with them. <br />
<br />
As a reminder, a zombie or vampire DLC is not sufficient - your base game must be about either of
these two creatures.<br />

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="asset"></a>Asset Kit</h2>
We’ve created an asset kit of images and templates for you to use on your own social media channels
when telling your fans about your participation in this event. These assets are designed to work
well on various platforms and you're welcome to use them to let players know you'll be
participating. Our official event trailer will typically launch around 4 days prior to the event; we
recommend the same timing for utilizing these assets to promote your participation on your own
channels. (please reference <a href="#dates">Important Dates</a> above).<br />

<ol>
    <li>
        Follow the link in the invitation email, or click this link to see your eligible games and
        register each:
        <a href="/optin/sale/zombies_vs_vampires" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"

            >https://partner.steamgames.com/promotion/discounts/dashboard/?10604</a
        >
    </li>
</ol>
<br />
<strong>Q. Will there be livestreaming as part of this event?</strong><br />
A. Livestreaming will not be featured on the sale page, but you're welcome to livestream on your own
game's store page as you wish.<br />
<br />
<strong>Q. I've changed my plans. How do I cancel my registration?</strong><br />

and deselect the checkbox at the very bottom of the page to remove your game from the event.<br />
<br />
<strong
    >Q. Can I promote our participation in the event on our own channels before the trailer goes
    live?</strong
><br />
A. Technically yes; you can publish once the Asset Kit is available for download, but we recommend
waiting until the event trailer is live (again, roughly 4 days prior to the event) as a more
effective communications beat with your audience.<br />
