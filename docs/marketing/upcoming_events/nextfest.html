<h1>Steam Next Fest</h1>
Steam Next Fest is a weeklong event focused on promoting upcoming games with playable demos.<br />
<br />
The primary goal of Steam Next Fest is to connect players with upcoming games they might be
interested in, while helping developers expose their future releases to potential fans and to gather
real-time feedback along the way.<br />
<br />
This page serves as a hub for evergreen information regarding Steam Next Fest which occurs three
times a year, in February, June, and October. For the latest dates, please check out the
<a href="/doc/marketing/upcoming_events#8">Upcoming Steam Events page</a>, or check out the
individual Next Fest pages available on the table on the left.

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="eligibility"></a>Eligibility</h2>
Each edition of Steam Next Fest is open to upcoming unreleased games that meet all of the following
criteria:<br />
<ul>
    <li>
        Has not previously joined a Next Fest; titles may only participate in
        <strong>ONE</strong> Next Fest<br />
    </li>
    <li>Is associated with a Steamworks developer account(s) in good standing<br /></li>
    <li>The base game store page must be published and public<br /></li>
    <li>Will include a publicly playable demo by the time Next Fest begins <br /></li>
    <li>Will not be released before Next Fest<br /></li>
    <li>
        Is not a prologue, preview, or short-form version of an existing game already released on
        Steam
    </li>
</ul>
<br />
Please note that there are no requirements regarding when your game releases (so long as it is after
Next Fest), and that there are no requirements regarding exclusivity, newness, or length of demo.
<br />
<br />
Some developers will choose to participate in Next Fest early in their development cycle to learn
more about what customers enjoy. Others will pick the one closest to launch in order to drum up
interest in the game shortly before release. There's no right answer- join the Next Fest that makes
the most sense for you and your title.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="preparing"></a>Preparing For Next Fest</h2>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="registration"></a>How Do I Register?</h2>
First things first: registration is done from the base game, and <i><u>not</u></i> the demo. For a
majority of titles, registration will be automatically available on the base game's App Landing
Page. If not, check out your dashboard for a link on how to either register or appeal for your game
to join.<br />
<br />
If you're still not able to find it, visit that Next Fest's documentation page for the direct link
to that Next Fest's registration &amp; appeals page.<br />
<br />
Once you complete your registration checklist, be sure to save and confirm that your base game is
registered for Next Fest. You should see a green checkmark on the App Landing Page.<br />

<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="demo"></a>Setting Up Your Demo</h2>
After registration, you'll need to set up your demo on Steam. This means setting up a demo type app,
which is attached to your base game on Steam. For more information about creating, testing, and
releasing a demo, please see the
<a href="/doc/store/application/demos">Demos documentation</a>.<br />
<br />
Be sure to submit your demo store assets and build for review at least 3-5 business days ahead of
your relevant deadline. It's important to give yourself extra time in case you fail build review the
first time and have to resubmit.<br />
<br />
Please note that build review is only to validate that the game has the features you've promised and
it runs - it is <i>not</i> a full QA process, and will not catch or even look for most bugs. Be sure
to do robust QA testing on your own!<br />
<br />
As with build changes across all of Steam, you are welcome to make changes to your demo build after
passing build review. However, we won't review your update, so make sure you don't ship a
game-breaking bug.
<div class="bb_callout bb_red">
    <div>
        If you publish a separate store page for your demo, be sure to go to the
        <i>base game</i> and republish so that the backend knows the two are related.
    </div>
</div>
<br />
Deadlines:<br />
<ul>
    <li>
        Submit your demo for review no later than <strong>4 weeks prior to the Fest</strong> if you
        plan to release your demo before Press Preview.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Submit your demo for review no later than <strong>2 week prior to the Fest</strong> if you
        plan to release your demo before the start of Next Fest.
    </li>
</ul>
<br />
You can release your demo <u>at any time</u> once it has been reviewed and approved. We highly
encourage you to release your demo at least 30 minutes before the start of Next Fest at the very
minimum. This gives you time to make sure it's working properly and troubleshoot any issues before
the event begins.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="trailer"></a>Being Included In The Trailer</h2>
To promote Steam Next Fest, our curation team selects a wide variety of games to feature in a video
trailer that we share with Press, and post to our social media channels. Our team begins the
selection process shortly after registration closes, and will notify potential candidates within one
week. Our goal is to select a variety of games that represent the diverse genres, themes, artstyles,
and scopes of games present within Next Fest.<br />
<br />
To be eligible, please complete the following before registration closes:<br />
<ul>
    <li>
        Finish registration and ensure that you meet the
        <a href="/doc/marketing/upcoming_events/nextfest#eligibility"
            >general eligibility criteria</a
        ><br />
    </li>
    <li>Have at least one publicly visible trailer on your base game store page<br /></li>
    <li>Be on track to publish a publicly playable demo by the start of Next Fest<br /></li>
    <li>
        Review and update your store page with your latest assets, game descriptions, and tags<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Be confident that you are ready for this Next Fest and will not need to cancel your
        registration
    </li>
</ul>
<br />
If we reach out about using your trailer, you will have approximately two weeks to give us
permission. If you choose to be included, we will make use of a trailer that is publicly visible on
your store page - we are not able to accept alternative videos. Be sure your most up-to-date
marketing materials are visible on your game's store page prior to a given edition's registration
deadline.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="presspreview"></a>Press Preview</h2>
Press Preview is a sneak peek of Next Fest that we send to select press outlets as an opportunity to
explore the full list of registered games ahead of the official launch. The Press Preview page will
give these outlets a chance to explore participating games and also allows press outlets to reach
out if theyâ€™d like to learn more about your game, begin to draft their articles, and otherwise be
prepared for the launch of Next Fest. Press will not have special access to your store page or your
demo, so whatever the general public will see is what press will be able to see.<br />
<br />
A few things to know about the press event:<br />
<ul>
    <li>
        Press Preview will include all games registered for Steam Next Fest <i>regardless</i> of
        current demo status. If you intend to cancel your registration, please do so prior to the
        start of Press Preview.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Press will be free to cover the included games at any time, and in any format (write-up,
        video, etc.). Some may want to give players a preview of games they're excited about ahead
        of the start of Next Fest, though that has historically been uncommon.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        If you'd like your demo to be accessible by the press during this event, prepare and release
        your demo before the start of Press Preview. Please note that releasing your demo will make
        it playable for everyone on Steam, not just press.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        If you provided contact information for your game on the Steam Next Fest registration form,
        we'll share that information with press.
    </li>
</ul>
<br />
If you're concerned about missing out on launch excitement if you release your demo early for the
Press Preview, do remember that demos don't have the same level of launch visibility on Steam as a
full game. That being said, we also can't guarantee whether any press will or will not play your
demo. It's up to you and whether you feel you are ready to release the demo at this stage.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="tips"></a>Tips For A Successful Next Fest</h2>
Be sure to review the (ever-growing!) list of
<a href="/doc/marketing/upcoming_events/nextfest/tips">Steam Next Fest Tips</a> and/or join a live
Q&amp;A session with members of the Steam Business Team (schedule provided in the timeline for each
edition) to learn how to make the most of your participation in Steam Next Fest.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="during"></a>During Next Fest</h2>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="visibility"></a>Game Visibility Within Next Fest</h2>
When you register your game for a given edition of Steam Next Fest, you will be asked to choose the
one or two primary genres that best fit your base game. We use this information to help sort the
location of your game within Next Fest, though the exact organization varies between each edition.
However, we will always use your selection for the category as well as your
<a href="/doc/store/tags">Steam Tags</a> to sort your title, so be sure those are accurate.<br />
<br />
A Developer Preview Page will be available before the start of the event so you can see how the Fest
will be organized and where your game is positioned within the Fest. We recommend checking this out,
as it gives you time to make adjustments if you aren't satisfied with which section(s) your title
appears in.<br />
<br />
If you have issues with how your game is showing up on the Next Fest page once the event has begun,
there are a few things you can check to determine the cause:<br />
<ol>
    <li>
        Ensure that your base game is properly registered and that you've selected one or two
        categories for your game on the registration form. You can also visit your game's Steam Next
        Fest registration page (link available in the respective edition's documentation page) to
        see a list of the categories and sections that your game is listed in.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Make sure you have released your game demo before the start of the Fest. Only games with
        released demos will be eligible to appear.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Make sure the store tags applied to your base game are accurate and complete. You may want
        to compare your <a href="/doc/store/tags">store page tags</a> with the categories and
        sub-categories listed within the Developer Preview Page and make any changes to your tags if
        necessary.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        If you've checked all of the above, please
        <a
            href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/wizard/HelpWithPublishing?issueid=932"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noreferrer"
            >reach out to us here</a
        >.
    </li>
</ol>
<br />
The intent behind Steam Next Fest is to give visibility to all participating titles; as such, the
first days of Next Fest are completely randomized in all locations except for explicitly named lists
and personalized segments, which are based on the userâ€™s play behavior. After a few days, logged-in
users will see the carousels personalized by an algorithm thatâ€™s based on user behavior during Next
Fest. This allows us to deliver personalized recommendations based on what users like you have been
playing.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="livestream"></a>Running A Livestream (Optional)</h2>
There is a section specifically for streams of participating games. This is an opportunity to stream
your game so potential players can see what it's like to play your game and possibly interact with
the developers behind the game. This is completely optional- if you do not have the experience or
time to set up a livestream, it's fine to focus your energy on the demo experience and the game
itself.<br />
<br />
A tutorial on <a href="/doc/store/broadcast/setting_up">streaming to your store page</a> is
available. If you plan on <a href="/doc/store/broadcast/demo">streaming your demo's</a> gameplay, be
sure to check out instructions on how to broadcast your demo - there are some specific things you
need to complete on Steam. You'll want to test your livestream ahead of the start of Next Fest. Once
you've tested your set-up and you've been able to stream to your game's store page, all you need to
do is repeat that process during Next Fest itself.<br />
<br />
If you have a VR game and would like to set up a livestream, there are additional factors to
consider. Because of the way the SteamVR.exe service interacts with broadcasting, you'll need to use
an external tool (such as OBS). That will give you the necessary control to configure your broadcast
and let you point Steam directly at your game appID rather than SteamVR.exe. For more details,
please see <a href="/doc/store/broadcast/setting_up">Setting Up A Stream</a>.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="after"></a>After Next Fest</h2>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="results"></a>Steam Next Fest: Wrap-up &amp; Results</h2>
Shortly after the most recent edition of Steam Next Fest concludes, Steam will launch a Wrap-up
event page featuring games with the most played demos from that edition. We will be emailing titles
that have earned a spot on that page, so be sure to keep an eye on your email after the event
concludes.

<h2 class="bb_subsection">
    <a name="faq_demo"></a><strong>Registration &amp; Eligibility Questions</strong>
</h2>
<br />
<strong>Q: I've changed my plans. How do I cancel my registration?</strong><br />
A: Just return to the registration page for your game by appending your appID to a given edition's
registration opt-in URL (provided in the event-specific documentation) and deselect the checkbox at
the very bottom of the page to remove your game from the event. You can also find the registration
link on your app landing page.<br />
<br />
<strong
    >Q: What happens if I end up releasing my game before or during a given edition of Steam Next
    Fest?</strong
><br />
A: Only unreleased games are eligible to participate in Steam Next Fest. If you release your game
prior to or during Steam Next Fest, your game will become ineligible and will not be included in the
event at that point. Ideally, you'll withdraw your registration ahead of time so we don't expect you
to be joining!<br />
<br />
<strong>Q: Are Early Access or free games eligible to participate in Steam Next Fest?</strong><br />
A: Yes, however, only unreleased titles are eligible for Steam Next Fest. If you plan on entering
Early Access or launching your game for free, that's fine, but the game must not yet be released to
remain eligible for Next Fest.<br />
<br />
<strong>Q: Why isn't my game listed as eligible to be registered?</strong><br />
A: Some common issues may prevent you from registering. Ensure that:<br />
<ul>
    <li>The store page for your game is published and visible to customers.<br /></li>
    <li>The game you're attempting to register has not been in a previous Next Fest<br /></li>
    <li>The release date of your game is not set to a date before the start of Next Fest.</li>
</ul>
<br />
<strong
    >Q: I've heard of Steam Playtests. Are games that have had or currently have a Playtest
    available, eligible to participate in Steam Next Fest?</strong
><br />
A: Yes, as use of a <a href="/doc/features/playtest">Steam Playtest</a> does not affect eligibility.
However, we do not recommend having a Playtest live during Steam Next Fest, as this splits your
players between the two builds instead of concentrating them in one spot. As a demo is required for
Next Fest, we would recommend pushing all your users towards your demo during the event.<br />
<br />
<strong
    >Q: Can I submit a different version or edition of my game that already participated in a
    previous edition of Steam Next Fest?</strong
><br />
A: No, you may not submit a different version or edition of a title that has previously participated
in Steam Next Fest. Prologues, Chapter Ones, and other short-form previews of another title are also
not allowed in Steam Next Fest. Please sign up with your base game.<br />
<br />
<strong>Q: Can I submit a re-release of an existing Steam game?</strong><br />
A: Steam Next Fest is intended for new games that have never been released on Steam before. If you
are releasing a new edition of an existing game, then your game is not eligible for Steam Next
Fest.<br />
<br />
<strong>Q: Can I release my demo before the start of Next Fest?</strong><br />
A: Yes, you can release your demo any time! Some choose to release the demo way in advance, some
choose to set it live as the Press Preview begins, and others choose to set it live right as Next
Fest begins. These are all valid strategies; pick the one that makes the most sense for your game.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="faq_demo"></a><strong>Demo Questions</strong></h2>
<br />
<strong>Q: How long should I leave my demo up after Steam Next Fest ends?</strong><br />
A: While it's up to you to decide what works best for your release strategy, we encourage you to
consider leaving your demo up beyond the conclusion of the Steam Next Fest you joined. Many players
have expressed disappointment when demos disappear immediately, so communicate to players if you
plan to deactivate your demo so they can prioritize playing it accordingly.<br />
<br />
<strong>Q: When should I launch my demo?</strong><br />
A: It's up to you! Our only requirement is that it is before the start of the event. You might
choose to set it live ahead of the Press Preview, or you might have some marketing beat that you'd
like to hit ahead of the start of Next Fest. We do not require exclusivity or newness for your demo,
so do what's right for your game and your plans.<br />
<br />
<strong>Q: Can I update my demo after it goes through the review process?</strong><br />
A: Absolutely. We know you're still working on your game and demo and you are welcome to continue
updating it even after it goes through the build review process. However, keep in mind we won't be
doing another build review, so it's up to you to make sure you haven't broken your game.
<h2 class="bb_subsection">
    <a name="faq_demo"></a><strong>Marketing &amp; Press Preview Questions</strong>
</h2>
<br />
<strong>Q: When can demo release notification emails be sent to wishlisters?</strong><br />
A: You get to press the button within 14 days of the launch of your demo. This is separate from Next
Fest - so if you used it months prior to Next Fest, you do not get a second opportunity at the
email.<br />
<br />
<strong>Q: Can games be featured outside of Steam or the official trailer?</strong><br />
A: Yes, but we cannot promise that other outlets will write about Steam Next Fest or your title.<br />
<br />
<strong
    >Q: Are there any paid advertising opportunities for Next Fest or on Steam in general?</strong
><br />
A: No.<br />
<br />
<strong>Q: How can I ensure I receive the relevant communications about Steam Next Fest?</strong
><br />
<br />
<strong>In Steamworks:</strong><br />
<ul>
    <li>
        If you're a member of multiple Steamworks partners, make sure you have the correct partner
        selected at the top of the Steamworks website.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Ensure you have at least one account with "Receive Steamworks communications" enabled. You
        can edit per user here:
        <a href="/pub/users/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
            >https://partner.steamgames.com/pub/users/</a
        >
        Note that accounts with this permission setting must also have completed or must newly
        complete the additional confirmation request sent via email authentication in order to fully
        enable permission.
    </li>
</ul>
<br />
<strong>In the Steam Store:</strong><br />
<ul>
    <li>
        Have relevant users verify their personal email opt-in/out settings and ensure "New
        Steamworks features are announced or sales events are available" is selected here:
        <a
            href="https://store.steampowered.com/account/emailoptout"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noreferrer"
            >https://store.steampowered.com/account/emailoptout</a
        >
    </li>
</ul>
<br />
If you prefer to remain opted out of all communications, you may still participate in Steam Next
Fest. However, the only indication of your eligibility for both the event overall and for the
marketing materials permissions opt-in (if your game has been selected for potential inclusion in
our official marketing materials as described above) will be via the options below:<br />
<ul>
    <li>
        Access the registration page for your game by appending your appID to a given edition's
        registration opt-in URL (provided in the event-specific documentation). <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Check for the opt-in on your base game's App Admin page (in the Marketing Tools &amp; Data
        section):
        <a href="/apps/landing/<appID>" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
            >https://partner.steamgames.com/apps/landing/&lt;appID&gt;</a

<br />
<strong>Q: Can I have more than one trailer?</strong><br />
A: Yes. See <a href="/doc/store/trailer">Trailers</a> for more details.<br />
<br />
<strong> Q: What is a microtrailer and how is it created?</strong><br />
A: Microtrailers are 6-second looping videos that summarize a game's trailer for use in quick-view
locations throughout the Steam Store, as in the various category hubs, special sale pages, and on
the homepage during seasonal sales events. Steam generates a game's micro trailer based on the first
video visible in its Store Page. It does this by taking six 1-second clips from various points in
the video and stitching them together.
