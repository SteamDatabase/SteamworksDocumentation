<h1>Steam Next Fest - Tips</h1>
Steam Next Fest is a great time to get your unreleased game in front of potential players and start
building your audience. What follows are some tips you may find useful for how to go about
interacting with fans, making sure your game is visible, and how to get the most out of your
participation in Steam Next Fest.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="1"></a>Your Demo</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Put a link on your demo home screen to where players can submit feedback</strong> -
        Make it easy for players of your demo to give you feedback. Put a button right there on your
        main menu of your demo, or in the pause menu, or both. It can link to a specific Steam
        sub-forum, your Discord channel, a bug tracker tool, your own forums, or wherever you want
        to collect feedback from players.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Indicate on your demo home screen if you will deactivate the demo, and when</strong>
        - Many players download demos with the intention of playing after the fest ends, so
        communicate to players if you plan to deactivate your demo after Steam Next Fest ends so
        that they can prioritize playing it accordingly. <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Create a sub-forum for demo feedback</strong> - Within your base game's Steam
        discussion forums, you can create new sub-forums. You can create one for the purposes of
        player feedback and discussions about your demo.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Make sure your demo is clearly listed on your store page</strong> - When you release
        your demo, make sure you also have the demo button added to your base game's store page. You
        do this under the "Edit Store Page &gt; Special Settings". Once you've added your demo
        there, make sure the box is checked that says "display above purchase options" to make it
        show up prominently on your store page.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Plan ahead for Build Review</strong> - Build review takes time, so make sure you set
        aside enough time for Steam to review your build and for you to address any feedback
        provided by review.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="2"></a>Live Streaming</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Test live streaming a few times</strong> - There are a lot of little bits to
        configure, so chances are good that it will take you a few attempts to get live streaming to
        work correctly. Best to try all that out well in advance of Next Fest to make sure that your
        stream goes smoothly. Learn more:
        <a href="/doc/store/broadcast/setting_up">Setting Up A Stream</a>. If you plan on streaming
        the Demo of your game, be sure to check out
        <a href="/doc/store/broadcast/demo"> Broadcasting a Game Demo to the Store Page</a>, as it
        works differently from regular livestreams.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Turn on broadcast chat by default</strong> - When you set your live stream to appear
        on your store page, you can configure the chat window to be open by default. Do this and
        players will know that you are there and available to chat with them. Engage: take questions
        from the chat and answer them in your live stream. Ask questions of your audience. Tell them
        stories. Be playful. Learn more:
        <a href="/doc/store/broadcast/moderation">Broadcast Moderation</a>.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Use a streaming tool that supports RTMP</strong> - This will give you more control
        over your stream and let you show your webcam so players know you are there. For common
        streaming issues see: <a href="/doc/store/broadcast/faq">Broadcasting FAQs</a> or
        <a href="/doc/store/broadcast/demo">Broadcasting Game Demos</a>.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="3"></a>Visibility within Steam Next Fest</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Set your demo live in time for press preview</strong> - Valve will be sharing the
        list of participating games with a list of press outlets 10 days prior to the start of Next
        Fest. If you release your demo by that date then press can potentially try out your demo.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Set your demo live in time for Next Fest</strong> - Steam Next Fest only includes
        games with demos, so please be sure to set yours live ahead of the start of Next Fest.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Check your tags/categories</strong> - Steam Next Fest is organized based on the
        categories you selected when you registered (up to 2 categories per game) and then based on
        the store tags applied to your game. If you don't select any categories, your game will
        <i>not</i> appear in Next Fest! Check out the developer preview page to see where your game
        is set to appear, and then consider the categories and sections that exist within Next Fest.
        You may want to add or remove some store tags from your base game to make it show up in more
        relevant sections of Next Fest.
    </li>
</ul>
