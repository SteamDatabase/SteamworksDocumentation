        store page for your BASE game (not your demo). This base game page is where your demo button
        will appear and where players will learn about your game. You will need to have a Coming
        Soon page set up and publicly visible in order to complete the registration.<br />

    </li>
    <li>
        Submit your demo store assets and build at least 3-5 business days ahead of the start of the

    <li>
        Release your demo. You can release your demo at any time once it has been reviewed and
        approved. We encourage you to release your demo a little before the festival starts to make
        sure it's working properly and you have enough time to troubleshoot any issues before the
        festival begins.<br />
        <ul class="bb_ul">
            <li>
                Release on <strong>June 2</strong> if you wish for your demo to be playable for

            >Broadcasting a Game Demo to the Steam Store</a
        >.<br />
    </li>
    <li>Tell your fans that you'll be participating in the festival!</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="7"></a>During the Festival (starts at 10am PDT on June 13th)</h2>
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>Release your demo if you haven't already<br /></li>
    <li>
        Promote your participation on social media and encourage fans to give your demo a try<br />
    </li>
    <li>Check your Community Hub and other social channels for feedback on your demo<br /></li>
    <li>Run your livestream(s) if you had planned one or two</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="demo"></a>Preparing your demo (required)</h2>
Steam Next Fest is built around the concept of giving players a chance to get hands-on with a
playable demo of your game. On Steam, that means setting up a specific demo type app, which is
attached to your full game on Steam. To learn about creating, testing, and releasing a demo, please
see
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/application/demos" class="bb_doclink"
    >Demos Documentation</a
>.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="livestream"></a>Running a livestream (optional)</h2>
During the festival, you have the opportunity to livestream your game so that potential players can
see what it's like to play your game and to interact with the developers behind the game.<br /><br /><strong
    >You can create up to two special Next Fest Livestream events</strong
>
to have your game listed in the livestreaming schedule and for Steam to promote your livestream to
players. While all active livestreams will always be available at any time for players to browse,
during your scheduled time your livestream will be featured more prominently. <br /><br /><a
    href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/marketing/upcoming_events/nextfest/scheduling"
    class="bb_doclink"
    >Read more about scheduling live streams</a
>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="trailer"></a>Trailer Usage</h2>
For the promotion of Next Fest, we select 10-20 games to feature in one or more video trailers that
we share with press, post to social media, and feature on the homepage of Steam. <br /><br />If you
selected the option during registration to give us permission, then we might use your game's
trailer. If we use your game's trailer, we'll make use of one that is set publicly visible on your
store page as of May 13th, 2022.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="presspreview"></a>Press Preview Event Details (Starts June 2nd)</h2>
We’ll be offering select press outlets the opportunity to explore the participating games starting
10 days ahead of the Next Fest (Thurs, June 2nd at 10am PDT). The press preview page will give these
outlets a chance to explore the participating games and browse by genre, theme, style, etc. and
learn about your games through the store pages that you already have up. This will give press
outlets a chance to see what is coming up, play any of the demos that are already available, and
reach out if they’d like to learn more about your game ahead of the festival.<br /><br />Here are a
couple of things to know about the press event:<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        Press will be free to write about the included games at any time. Some may want to give
        players a preview of games they are excited about ahead of time.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        If you'd like your demo to be accessible by the press during this event, please simply
        prepare and release your demo on or ahead of the press event start on June 2nd. Make sure
        you plan for 3-5 days for your demo build to be reviewed ahead of release.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        This Press Preview will be conducted with a set of press outlets that we are specifically
        contacting for this purpose.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="visibility"></a>Visibility of Games</h2>
Games are organized within the Steam Next Fest page based on the categories you select when you
register and based on the tags you have applied to your base game's store page.<br /><br />A
developer preview page will be available before the start of the event so you can see how the
festival will be organized and where your game is positioned within the festival. If you have issues
with your game showing up on the Next Fest page, there are a few things you can check to determine
the cause:<br />
<ol class="bb_ol">
    <li>
        Ensure that your base game is properly registered for the festival and that you've selected
        one or two categories for your game on the registration form. You can also visit your game's
        <a
            href="https://partner.steamgames.com/optin/sale/nextfest_june_2022/"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noreferrer"
            >Next Fest registration page</a
        >
        to see a list of the categories and sections that your game is listed in.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Make sure you have released your game demo before the start of the festival at 10am Pacific
        time. Only games with released demos will be eligible to appear on the festival pages.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Make sure the store tags applied to your base game are accurate and complete. You may want
        to compare your
        <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/tags" class="bb_doclink"
            >store page tags</a
        >
        with the categories and sub-categories listed within the Next Fest developer preview page
        and make any changes to your tags if necessary. For example, if you believe your game should
        be appearing in "Point-and-click adventure" games section, make sure that you've selected
        the "Adventure" category on the registration form and make sure your base game has the tag
        "Point-and-click" applied to it.
    </li>
</ol>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="asset"></a>Asset Kit</h2>
Here you will be able to download a kit of images and templates to use in your own social media
channels when telling your fans about your participation in Steam Next Fest. These images are
designed to fit well with various social media channels and you are welcome to use these assets any
time you are ready to let players know that you'll be part of Steam Next Fest. The hashtag on
Twitter is #SteamNextFest.<br /><br />Please come back in May for the asset kit!

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="faq"></a>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<br />Members of the Steam Business team have held a few live Q&amp;A sessions for developers to ask
questions about registering for and getting the most out of Steam Next Fest. <br /><br />Here is a
recording of the March 30, 2022 session: <br /><a

    target="_blank"
    rel="noreferrer"
    id="dynamiclink_1"
    >https://youtu.be/UHZgTmn9rr0</a
><br /><br /><strong
    >Q: Are Early Access games eligible to participate in the Steam Next Fest?</strong
><br />A: Only games that have not released a playable build yet are eligible. If your game is
already released and available in Steam Early Access by the start of the festival, then your game is
not eligible to participate in the Steam Next Fest.<br /><br /><strong
    >Q: Why isn't my game listed as eligible to be registered?</strong
><br />A: Some common issues that may prevent you from registering are:<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>Ensure that the store page for your game is set visible as 'coming soon'<br /></li>
    <li>
        If you are a member of multiple Steamworks partners, make sure you have the correct partner
        selected at the top of the Steamworks website.
    </li>
</ul>
<br /><strong>Q. Are free games eligible to participate in the Steam Next Fest?</strong><br />A. The
Next Fest is built around the concept of displaying demos that are associated with a full game. So
if you are making a game that you intend to be free in the future, you can still participate by
creating and releasing a
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/application/demos" class="bb_doclink">demo</a>. As
with any game, you would still register your base full game for the Next Fest.<br /><br /><strong
    >Q: Do I need to have my game and store page reviewed in order to register?</strong
><br />A: Yes, your base game's store page must be publicly visible in order to complete
registration. The Valve curation team looks at each store page, including any screenshots, trailers,
and description in order to determine which games we will be highlighting during the festival.<br /><br /><strong
    >Q. What if I end up releasing my game before or during the Next Fest?</strong
><br />A. Only unreleased games are eligible to participate in the Next Fest. If you release your
game prior to or during the Next Fest, your game will become ineligible and will not be included in
the festival pages.<br />
<br /><strong>Q. I've changed my plans. How do I cancel my registration?</strong><br />A. Just
return to the registration page for your game by inserting your appID at the end of this URL
<a
    href="https://partner.steamgames.com/optin/sale/nextfest_june_2022/(appid)"
    target="_blank"
    rel="noreferrer"
    >https://partner.steamgames.com/optin/sale/nextfest_june_2022/(appid)</a
>
and deselect the checkbox at the very bottom of the page to remove your game from the festival.
After opting out, if you have not released your game prior to a future Next Fest, you could
participate in that one assuming the rest of the eligibility requirements were met.<br /><br /><strong
    >Q. How will my game be categorized within the Steam Next Fest pages?</strong
><br />A. When you register your game for the Steam Next Fest you will be asked to choose the one or
two primary categories that best fit your game. These categories determine which tabs your game can
appear within the fest. Then, within each tab, the fest is broken down into sub-genres. Your game
can appear in one or more of these sub-genres based on the store tags applied to your base game. For
more information on tags, please see
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/tags" class="bb_doclink">Store Tags</a>
documentation.<br /><br /><strong
    >Q. How do I schedule a livestream to show up in the Next Fest?</strong
><br />A. The scheduling tool will become available in late May, shortly after registration closes.
Once available, you will be able to create up to two special Next Fest Livestream events within the
Steam Events &amp; Announcements tool - the same place that you go to post announcements and
schedule other forms of events for your game.<br /><br /><strong
    >Q. Can I submit a different version or edition of my game that already participated in a
    previous Next Fest?</strong
><br />A. You may not submit a different version or edition of a title that has previously
participated in a Next Fest.<br /><br /><strong
    >Q. Can I submit a re-release of an existing Steam game?</strong
><br />A. Steam Next Fest is intended for new games that have never been playable on Steam before.
If you are releasing a new edition of an existing game, then your game is not eligible for Steam
Next Fest.<br /><br /><strong>Q. How do I set up a livestream for my VR game?</strong><br />A.
Because of the way the SteamVR.exe service interacts with broadcasting, you will need to use an
external tool (such as OBS). That will give you the necessary control to configure your broadcast,
and let you point Steam directly at your game appID rather than SteamVR.exe. For more details,
please see
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/broadcast/setting_up" class="bb_doclink"
    >Setting Up A Stream</a
><br /><br /><strong>Q. Do I need to release my demo for the Press Preview?</strong><br />A. No, you
can wait and release your demo on June 13th if you wish. Releasing on June 2nd will allow your demo
to be playable for press participating in the Press Preview, but isn't necessary. Your game will
still be listed on the Press Preview page either way.<br /><br /><strong
    >Q. Won't I miss some launch excitement if I release my demo early for the Press
    Preview?</strong
><br />A. Demos don't have the same level of launch visibility as a full game, so it shouldn't be
very disruptive to release a demo ahead of Next Fest. But, we also can't guarantee whether any press
will or will not play your demo. It's up to you and whether you feel you are ready.
