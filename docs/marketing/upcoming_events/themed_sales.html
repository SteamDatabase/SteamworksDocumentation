Steam regularly hosts themed sale events (typically designated as Fests) to showcase various genres
and categories of games. <br />
<br />
These events: <br />
<ul>
    <li>Have specific eligibility requirements and criteria</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Utilize an auto-invitation and registration process</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Are typically promoted on the front page of Steam</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Lead to sale pages with event-specific sub-categories</li>
</ul>
<br />
Note that a discount is not required to participate in these events, though the event page will most
prominently feature discounted games.<br />
<br />
Below is information relevant to all Steam themed sale events. Eligibility criteria, timelines, and
other details specific to each event are available in the respective event documentation pages
(accessible via the documentation table of contents to the left).

</ul>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="selection_invitation"></a>Selection and Invitation Process</h2>
Each themed sale event has different eligibility criteria built around the core theme of the event,
usually determined by the primary mechanic(s) of the game. For each event, we will automatically
select and invite eligible games where the primary theme or mechanic of the game is in alignment
with the theme of the sale. Partners usually have six weeks or more to register for the event and
enter any desired discounts.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="2"></a>Selection Process and Eligibility</h2>
Eligibility is determined by the tags applied to your game's store page, as well as the gameplay
that is evident from how you describe and represent your game on your store page. <br />
<br />
To ensure your game is considered for invitation to a themed sale event, please make sure the store
tags on your game are both truthful as to the content of your game and match the theme of the sale
you are considering. For example, to be considered for the Racing sale, games must have the racing
tag applied to their game store page; to be considered for the JRPG sale, a game must have the JRPG
tag.<br />
<br />
Some games have a particular mode, or portion of the game that matches a theme. However, in order to
be eligible, a game must be primarily about the theme. For example, an adventure game that includes
a racing mini-game would not be eligible for the Racing Sale. We will filter out games that are not
built around the primary theme of the event.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="3"></a>Invitation Process</h2>
<br />
From the resulting list of eligible games, we will send email invitations to the developers
associated with each game. This invitation will go out to Steamworks users who have set "Receive
Steamworks communications" permission for eligible games. Reference the
<a href="#faq">Frequently Asked Questions</a> below to ensure your communication preferences are set
to permit these communications, or for details on how to access key information if opted out. <br />
<br />
The invitation will ask you to register your game for the given event, which is as easy as clicking
one checkbox and saving. This registration tells us which games intend to participate.<br />
<br />
Once registered, users in your account with "Edit Pricing Permissions" will then see the given event
appear in the Discount Management page and can enter discounts for your game there.<br />
<br />
If you have not received an email invitation to an announced event for which you have a game you
believe fits the established criteria, please check your list of eligible games (instructions are
provided in the documentation specific to each event). If your game is not present there and you
believe it meets the eligibility criteria, please use the appeals process available at the bottom of
that event's registration page.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="participate"></a>Ways To Participate</h2>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="4"></a>Discounts</h2>
A discount is not required to participate in Steam themed sale events, though each event page will
most prominently feature discounted games. <br />
<br />
<strong
    >Reminder: All sales and discount opportunities are subject to the same cooldown between
    discounts.</strong
>
Themed Sale Events adhere to the discount cooldown, and no exceptions are possible. The only
exceptions to the discount cooldown are the four major Steam seasonal sales. For more details on
discounting, please see <a href="/doc/marketing/discounts">Discounting</a>. <br />
<br />
If you would like to use a custom discount instead of the official discount listed in the Discount
Management page, you are welcome to do so. We would recommend using the official discount listed to
guarantee your title is discounted for the duration of the event.<br />
<br />
To quickly review which of your titles have been registered, your
<a href="/promotion/discounts/dashboard/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
    >Discount Management page</a
>
(<i>Apps &amp; Packages</i> -&gt; <i>Discount Management</i>) is available. <br />
<br />
You may enter your discount at any time prior to the event start for the given event in which you
are participating, though we encourage you to enter your discounts early! If Valve has requested an
additional opt-in for marketing materials inclusion consideration, the deadline to opt in (to the
event and the marketing materials permissions) as well as enter your discount is typically 6 weeks
prior to event start. Exact deadlines are provided in the Important Dates section of the
event-specific documentation. For more information about marketing materials inclusion, see the
<a href="#permissions">Marketing Materials Permissions</a> section below.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="5"></a>Demos and Upcoming Releases</h2>
Unless otherwise indicated in the event-specific documentation, if you have an upcoming game that
fits the established criteria (or even if you have a released game) you may release/register the
upcoming game and/or a demo to include in the event. Each event will include sections for games with
free demos and upcoming games. Note that for demos, registration is based on the base game Store
Page information, so keep tags for the base game up to date and accurate.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="6"></a>Free to Play Games</h2>
Unless otherwise indicated in the event-specific documentation, free to play games are welcome to
participate and will be included in a section for free to play games.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="event_visibility"></a>Event Visibility and Promotion</h2>
Steam themed sale events have a dedicated sale page for the duration of the event and are typically
promoted significantly on the homepage of Steam, in pop-up marketing messages, and/or via our social
media channels. <br />
<br />
Event visibility will depend on the current schedule of Steam promotions, but some examples of
possible marketing visibility include:<br />

<br />
Additionally, a game participating in a given event typically will have an event banner applied to
its store page for the duration of the event. If your game is participating in other events
simultaneously that also have store page banners for the respective event, which banner is displayed
will depend on the hierarchy of events, currently set to:<br />
<br />
<ol>
    <li>Franchise Sale<br /></li>
    <li>Developer/Publisher Sale<br /></li>
    <li>Third Party Sale<br /></li>
    <li>Steam Themed Sale Event</li>
</ol>
<br />
If there are multiple events in the same category running concurrently, the earlier published event
takes priority.<br />

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="game_visibility"></a>Game Visibility Within Each Event</h2>
Each Steam themed sale event will be organized into top-level categories including Discounted, VR,
Free to Play, Demos, and Upcoming games, as well as sub-sections relevant for the theme. Some games
may fit neatly into multiple sub-sections, while others may only logically fit into a single
subsection. We'll do our best to balance the sale page presentation to ensure that most games have a
few logical sections where players would expect to find the game.<br />
<br />
Within each section of the sale page, games may be sorted based on heuristics like player interest
and popularity, while other sections may be more random.<br />
<br />
We cannot guarantee specific featuring or positions within each event.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="permissions"></a>Marketing Materials Permissions</h2>
For the promotion of a Steam themed sale event, we typically select a handful of games to feature in
the official trailer we edit for the event. The trailer will be posted to some combination of the
official Steam YouTube channel, the event page (when the event is live), and Steam social media
channels, and will also be distributed to press.<br />
<br />
In order to remain in consideration for inclusion for a given event, by the deadline indicated in
the event registration opt-in and/or email you must: <br />
<ul>
    <li>
        Have received an additional opt-in request from Valve specifically indicating that your game
        is in consideration for inclusion in official marketing materials and have completed this
        opt-in. This notification will have been included on the event registration page for your
        game or sent via email typically at least six weeks prior to the event.<br />
    </li>
    <li>Be registered to participate in the event and have entered a discount.<br /></li>
    <li>Have at least one publicly visible trailer on your store page.</li>
</ul>
<br />
If you authorize trailer use and we use your game's trailer, we'll make use of one that is publicly
visible on your store page. We do not accept any unreleased/unpublished content for consideration -
please do not send us additional information regarding your title.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="faq"></a>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<strong>Q. Do I need to register my game before entering a discount?</strong><br />
A. Yes, you need to do the following things in order:<br />

<br />
<strong
    >Q. How can I ensure I receive the relevant communications about Steam themed sale
    events?</strong
><br />
<br />
<strong>In Steamworks:</strong><br />
<ul>
    <li>
        If you're a member of multiple Steamworks partners, make sure you have the correct partner
        selected at the top of the Steamworks website.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Ensure you have at least one account with "Receive Steamworks communications" enabled. You
        can edit per user here:
        <a href="/pub/users/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
            >https://partner.steamgames.com/pub/users/</a
        >
        Note that accounts with this permission setting must also have completed or must newly
        complete the additional confirmation request sent via email authentication in order to fully
        enable permission.
    </li>
</ul>
<br />
<strong>In the Steam Store:</strong><br />
<ul>
    <li>
        Have relevant users verify their personal email opt-in/out settings and ensure "New
        Steamworks features are announced or sales events are available" is selected here:
        <a
            href="https://store.steampowered.com/account/emailoptout"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noreferrer"
            >https://store.steampowered.com/account/emailoptout</a
        >
    </li>
</ul>
<br />
If you prefer to remain opted out of all communications, you may still participate in Steam themed
sale events. However, the only indication of your eligibility for both the event overall and for the
marketing materials permissions opt-in (if your game has been selected for potential inclusion in
our official marketing materials as described above) will be via the options below:<br />
<ul>
    <li>
        Access the registration page for your game by appending your appID to a given event's
        registration opt-in URL (provided in the event-specific documentation). <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Check for the opt-in on your base game's App Admin page (in the Marketing Tools &amp; Data
        section):
        <a href="/apps/landing/<appID>" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
            >https://partner.steamgames.com/apps/landing/&lt;appID&gt;</a
        >
    </li>
</ul>
<br />
<strong>Q. I've changed my plans. How do I cancel my registration?</strong><br />
A. Just return to the registration page for your game by appending your appID to a given event's
registration opt-in URL (provided in the event-specific documentation) and deselect the checkbox at
the very bottom of the page to remove your game from the event.
