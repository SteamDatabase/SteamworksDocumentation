<h1>Curator Lists For Steam Events</h1>
Steam Curators can associate a list of reviewed games to a Steam Sale (for example:
<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/fightinggamesale" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
    >Steam Fighting Game Sale</a
>) or an Event (for example:
<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/steamgamefestival" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
    >Steam Game Festival</a
>) that will automatically be displayed to the curator's followers. This allows curators to help
guide their fans on exploring the sale's featured games.<br />
<br />
The sale or event operator may optionally choose to feature one or more curators to help provide
recommendation guidance for Steam customers who may not be logged in or who do not follow any
relevant curators.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="1"></a>In brief</h2>
To participate with a list in this way, you'll need to follow these steps:<br />
<ol class="bb_ol">
    <li>
        Write a brief review for each game in the festival, sale, or event that you want to help
        your followers discover<br />
    </li>
    <li>Create a list that includes all those reviewed games<br /></li>
    <li>Associate that list with the intended event</li>
</ol>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="2"></a>Requirements</h2>
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        You'll need a
        <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/about/curators/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
            >Steam Curator page</a

        in good standing<br />
    </li>
    <li>

        Steam Curator group.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="3"></a>List visibility</h2>
This feature allows Steam Curator lists to appear on sales and events pages within Steam. Here is a
mockup of how a list may be presented on a sale page.<br />
<br />
<strong>Note: The following is a mockup. This may change in the future</strong><br />

/><br />
<br />
By default all of the curator recommendations will appear towards the bottom of the sales page. The
sale operator can choose to place the section in a different place in the sale.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="example"></a>Examples</h2>
<ol class="bb_ol">
    <li>
        An example sale page featuring a single curator list:
        <a
            href="https://store.steampowered.com/developer/valve/sale/example_sale_page"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noreferrer"
            >example sale page</a
        ><br />
    </li>
    <li>
        An example curator's list with an embedded video and various game display formats:
        <a
            href="https://store.steampowered.com/curator/39683464/list/73515"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noreferrer"
            >example curator list</a
        >
    </li>
</ol>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="setup"></a>Setting up a list</h2>
<ol class="bb_ol">
    <li>
        On your curator group's store page (for example:
        <a
            href="https://store.steampowered.com/curator/39683464-Example-Curator"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noreferrer"
            >example curator</a
        >), start by choosing the 'Admin Tab' found at the top and then choosing 'Create New List'
        which is found on the left side.<br />
        <br />
        <img
            src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/curator_admin_create.png"
            alt="curator_admin_create.png"
            title="curator_admin_create.png"
        /><br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Enter a title and a description of the list. These will be shown prominently when the list
        is display on a Steam Sale page. This is the key information the users has to decide whether
        they want to leave the sale to explore your recommendations.<br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Next add one or more games to the list that are featured on the sales page. Please remember
        that it will only allow adding games to the list that have previously been reviewed by your
        curator. <br />
        <br />
        If you just created a review, it often takes up to 5 minutes for the list to refresh with
        the updated list of reviews. The review text provided during the review will be used and
        displayed on the list.
        <div class="bb_callout">
            <div>
                Note: Games that are not featured in the sales will not be presented to the Steam
                customer
            </div>
        </div>
        <br />

            alt="curator_add_app.png"
            title="curator_add_app.png"
        />
        <br />
        <br />
        <img

            alt="curator_add_dialog.png"
            title="curator_add_dialog.png"
        /><br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Choose from the drop down the Steam Event to associate with. <br />
        <br />
        <img
            src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/build_list.png"
            alt="build_list.png"
            title="build_list.png"
        /><br />
        <br />
        Its important to remember that only once an event has started and the event is visible to
        Steam customers then it will appear in this list. The event will only present in the list
        for up to one month after the event has started <br />
        <br />
        This action associates this list with the Steam sale/event. This also will act as a filter,
        once associated, only games featured in the Steam sale/event will appear on the user visible
        page<br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Optional: You may enter a URL for a Youtube video to display at the top of your list page.
        This should be video that covers the games in your list. For instance, it might be play
        through or a mixed teasers of the various games. The video will be included at the top of
        the list and will be immediately playable for Steam customer that is visiting your list.<br />
        <br />
        URL format:
        <div class="bb_code">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=&lt;video id&gt;</div>
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        If the list is associated with sale, then it will appear to all of your followers on the
        sale page, regardless on whether the list is marked unlisted or public. The 'Unlisted'
        setting only removes the list from the curator list page or appearing in the appropriate
        carousel on your curator home page. The 'unlisted' setting has no effect on inclusion on
        sales page for your followers or being featured on them by the sales operator<br />
        <br />
        If you do not want a list to appear on the sale page, then do not associate it with the sale
        as described in the earlier step, until you are ready.
    </li>
</ol>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="display"></a>List Rendering</h2>
<br />
There are two choice on how to display the apps on your list page. You can either choose 'Grid' or
'List'.
<div class="bb_callout">
    <div>
        Note: These screen shots are mockups, and may change their style and layout in the future
    </div>
</div>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="grid"></a>Grid Display</h2>
Grid allows up to two games capsule appear side by side. If your individual game review optionally
contains a link to an article, then the game will display as the following in the grid.:<br />
<br />
<img
    src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/grid_review_link.png"
    alt="grid_review_link.png"
    title="grid_review_link.png"
/><br />
<br />
If instead of a link to an article, it contains a youtube video in the suggested format:<br />
<br />
<div class="bb_code">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=&lt;video id&gt;</div>
<br />
This allows us to render the youtube video inline in a way that the Steam customer can immediately
play the content.<br />
<br />
<img
    src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/grid_video.png"
    alt="grid_video.png"
    title="grid_video.png"
/>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="list"></a>List Display</h2>
<br />
In the list display, each game capsules appear alone on its row. Its ideal for larger embedded
reviews per game as there is more screen real-state to show the custom descriptions. <br />
<br />
If your individual game review optionally contains a link to an article, then the games capsule will
display with your content and the link as follows:<br />
<br />
<img
    src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/list_reviewlink.png"
    alt="list_reviewlink.png"
    title="list_reviewlink.png"
/><br />
<br />
If instead of a link to an article, we have included a link to a Youtube video review or additional
context about the game, then it will display as the following:<br />
<br />
<img
    src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/list_video.png"
    alt="list_video.png"
    title="list_video.png"
/><br />
<br />
The suggested format for inserting a youtube video per review is the following:<br />
<br />
<div class="bb_code">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=&lt;video id&gt;</div>
