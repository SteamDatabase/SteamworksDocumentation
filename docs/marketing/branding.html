<h1>Steam Branding Guidelines</h1>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Introduction</h2>
To ensure that Steam branding and trademarks are used consistently across all marketing and
communication materials, we have some guidelines that should be followed by all partners when using
Steam branding.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="2"></a>General Guidelines</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        The Steam logo may not be used in any manner that might imply that any non-Valve materials
        are sponsored, endorsed, licensed by, or affiliated with Valve.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        The Steam trademarks may not be displayed as primary or prominent features on any non-Valve
        materials.<br />
    </li>
    <li>Use only approved Valve artwork for the logo.<br /></li>
    <li>
        The Logo must stand alone and may not be combined with any object, including but not limited
        to other logos, words, graphics, photos, slogans, numbers, design features, or symbols.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Valve reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to modify guidelines regarding the Steam
        trademark, and may request that third parties modify or delete any use of the Logo that, in
        Valve's sole judgment, does not comply with these guidelines or might otherwise impair
        Valve's rights in the Steam trademark. Valve further reserves the right to object to unfair
        uses or misuse of its trademarks or other violations of applicable laws.
        <i
            >Valve also reserves the right to approve any communication using the Steam brand before
            its distribution.</i
        >
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="3"></a>Legal Attribution</h2>
Use the Steam logo with the "®" servicemark. This legal attribution must be provided, unless some
alternative attribution is provided by Valve:<br />
<br />
<ul>
    ©2025 Valve Corporation. Steam and the Steam logo are trademarks and/or registered trademarks
    of Valve Corporation in the U.S. and/or other countries.
</ul>

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="8"></a>Steam Early Access Branding Requirements</h2>
We work hard to make sure that customers understand what they are buying when they get an Early
Access title on Steam. We feel it is equally important that customers buying Steam Early Access
titles in other places also understand what they are getting. For that reason, we require that you
include the following information anywhere you sell Steam keys for your Early Access title:<br />
<br />
<ol>
    <li>
        Display one of these Steam Early Access logos:<br />
