UTM Analytics in Steamworks provides insight into on how your UTM marketing campaigns are
performing. You can use UTM parameters on a link with your Steam store page as the destination
address, and Steamworks will provide insight into how that link is performing.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>What is UTM?</h2>
UTM (Urchin Tracking Module) is an industry standard approach to measuring whether specific links in
your marketing campaigns are being clicked by customers. A link using UTM has specifically named
parameters following the link's destination address. These parameters make it clear which link was
clicked when a customer visits the destination address. For more background on UTM, see here:

    >https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTM_parameters</a
>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="2"></a>How it works</h2>
Steamworks records the UTM parameters used when a customer visits your game's store page and takes
an action such as purchasing or adding to their wishlist. A dashboard in Steamworks displays this
UTM information for you to evaluate how your campaigns are performing.<br />
<br />
The report has three sections: an overview of total traffic and conversions, a graph showing total
traffic and conversions over time, and a breakdown table showing how each unique combination of UTM
parameters performed. There are a set of filters at the top to narrow the data to specific UTM
parameters, as well as download the data as a .csv file.<br />

<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="3"></a>Privacy</h2>
To protect customer privacy, the information provided is kept at a summary view with no personal
data included. This allows you to learn how your campaigns are performing while also protecting
customer privacy. Here are more details on how Steam protects customer privacy:<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>Steam IDs or other personal information will never be included or available<br /></li>
    <li>We only provide visit and conversion data in total numbers<br /></li>
    <li>
        We exclude showing unique UTM parameter combinations in the breakdown table when visits for
        those combinations do not meet minimum thresholds.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Some users will not be tracked based on their browser configuration or cookie preferences
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="4"></a>Required Steamworks Permissions</h2>
Access to your UTM Analytics report is limited to Steamworks accounts with the "View Marketing
Traffic Data" rights for your game.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="5"></a>Tracked Visits</h2>
Three types of visits are tracked for UTM Analytics:<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        Total Visits: The total number of visits to your product page that had a UTM code attached
        to the URL.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Trusted Visits: A subset of Total Visits that excludes bot traffic and search crawlers.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Tracked Visits: The total number of visits to your product page for which users were also
        logged in. Excludes traffic that exhibits abnormal behavior such as repeated visits at a
        high rate.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="6"></a>Conversions</h2>
When users visit your store page via a UTM link and log in to Steam, Steamworks increments the
"Tracked Visits" count and also reports on conversions by those users. <br />
<br />
The types of conversions reported are:<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li><strong>Wishlist</strong>: customer added your game to their wishlist <br /></li>
    <li><strong>Purchases</strong>: customer purchased your game<br /></li>
    <li>
        <strong>Activations</strong>: customer acquired a license for your free-to-play game, or
        redeemed a key to acquire the game
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="7"></a>Conversion timeframe</h2>
For the above actions, Steam will count it as an conversion if the user takes that action within 72
hours of clicking through your UTM link, even if they visit other pages in between.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="8"></a>Example</h2>
Here's an example of a link to a Steam store page with properly formatted UTM parameters.<br />
<div class="bb_code">
    https://store.steampowered.com/app/480?utm_source=homepage&amp;utm_campaign=summer_sale&amp;utm_medium=web
</div>
<br />
If that link was clicked by customers 20 times, the UTM Analytics report for App ID 480 would show
20 visits in the "Total Visits" column for that unique combination of utm_source, utm_campaign, and
utm_medium. <br />
<br />

    alt="clicks_conversions.png"
    title="clicks_conversions.png"
/><br />
<br />
The report also shows 6 of the 20 visits were by customers signed in to Steam. Steamworks attributed
2 wishlist additions, and 1 purchase, to the 6 "Tracked Visits".
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="9"></a>Getting Started</h2>
UTM Analytics in Steamworks is already enabled for your game. Here's how to get started.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="10"></a>Viewing the report</h2>
You can access the UTM dashboard via a tab in the Marketing &amp; Visibility section for your game.
If you don't see the UTM Analytics tab, check if you have the "View Marketing Traffic Data"
permission for the game as that permission is required.<br />
<br />

    alt="utm_tabs.png"
    title="utm_tabs.png"
/>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="11"></a>Creating a link</h2>
Links with UTM parameters are recorded by Steam if the following criteria is met:<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        Must refer to an <strong>app</strong> page on Steam. Links to other pages on Steam are not
        currently supported.
        <div class="bb_code">store.steampowered.com/app/YOUR_APP_ID</div>
    </li>
    <li>Must include the <strong>utm_source</strong> or <strong>utm_campaign </strong>parameter</li>
</ul>
The complete list of supported UTM parameters is: <br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li><strong>utm_source</strong><br /></li>
    <li><strong>utm_campaign</strong><br /></li>
    <li><strong>utm_medium</strong><br /></li>
    <li><strong>utm_content</strong><br /></li>
    <li><strong>utm_term</strong></li>
</ul>
<br />
Using any combination of letters, numbers, and other characters supported by URLs, you can append
any term to each of those parameters for your own purpose. See example above.<br />
<br />
There are two ways to evaluate the data reported by UTM Analytics<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        The graph of data over time, and the breakdown table which supports filtering and sorting<br />
    </li>
    <li>Download the data as a .csv file for use in the analytics tool of your choice</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="12"></a>Testing a link</h2>
A tool to test if your link is valid is available on the UTM report via the "Test a UTM Link"
button. It's also a good idea to test links in a web browser. Note: visit counts on the UTM
dashboard are updated hourly. Conversions are finalized 4 days after the visit.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="13"></a>Tracked Visits - Known Challenges</h2>
Tracked Traffic reports the users that are signed in to Steam in some way, including the desktop
client, desktop web browser, mobile app, or mobile web browser. Many social media mobile apps, where
you may be running advertisements, make it really hard to direct traffic outside their app. It is
unlikely that many players are signed into Steam within the built-in browser inside those social
media apps, and thus it is hard for the user to take direct action. Many of those players may
manually switch to the Steam mobile app, or open their desktop app and search for your game, but we
cannot connect those actions with the originating advertisement.<br />
<br />
It is generally challenging to follow user interactions that cross between browsers, devices, or
apps in a way that also respects player privacy. Steam's methods for recording tracked visits errs
on the side of retaining user privacy, and thus you may notice some limits to how many UTM actions
show up as tracked.<br />
<br />
Here are a few details that you may find helpful in explaining these limitations:<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        If a user clicks a UTM link in their browser and then signs in to their Steam account within
        the same browser, Steam can attribute the subsequent conversion to the original source.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        However, if a player switches browsers or launches the Steam client and searches for the
        game, we have no way to associate their actions in one browser with conversions in another.
    </li>
</ul>
<br />
There are a couple of ways that Steam tries to help players get into a state where they can take an
action on a game. In these scenarios, Steam is able to follow the user and can properly attribute
any conversions: <br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        On Desktop: If the user follows an advertisement and lands in a browser where they are not
        signed in, they will see a banner across the top prompting them to open the page in their
        Steam client. If they click that button, it will try to open Steam (if they have it
        installed) and take them to the same page within the client. If that succeeds, we can
        continue following that action through to conversion.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        On mobile: if the user follows an advertisement and lands in a browser where they are not
        signed in, there will be a banner across the bottom of the browser prompting them to open in
        the mobile app. If they click that, and it succeeds in taking them to the Steam mobile app,
        then we can follow that action as well through to conversion.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="14"></a>FAQ</h2>
<h4>Q. Why is Steam providing UTM Analytics?</h4>
A. This was built in response to the frequent requests from game developers for UTM reporting tools
in Steamworks.
<h4>Q. Why am I not seeing UTM visits for my campaign?</h4>
A. Here are some possible reasons:
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        Your Steamworks account does not have the "View Marketing Traffic Data" permission. For
        account permission information, please see
        <a
            href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/gettingstarted/managing_users#9"
            class="bb_doclink"
            >Managing Your Steamworks Account &gt; Group Permissions</a
        ><br />
    </li>
    <li>
        If your campaign just started you may need to wait for the UTM dashboard to refresh. Visit
        counts refresh hourly.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        We exclude showing unique UTM parameter combinations in the breakdown table when visits for
        those combinations do not meet minimum thresholds.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        There may be an issue with the link. Use the "Test a UTM Link" tool (available via a button
        on UTM Dashboard) to check if your link meets reporting requirements.
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>Q. What are Tracked Visits?</h4>
A. Tracked visits are by users who <strong>logged into</strong> Steam in the browser where they
opened the UTM link. This also includes visits from UTM links that open via the Steam Mobile App.
Only tracked visits are eligible for conversion (wishlist, purchase, activation) reporting.
<h4>
    Q. Will it count as a conversion if the customer purchases a different game from my catalog?
</h4>
A. Only a wishlist, purchase, or activation of the same App ID used in the UTM link will currently
be considered a conversion. We hope to expand on our conversion insights to include scenarios like
this.
<h4>Q. Will it count as a conversion if the customer downloads the game's Demo or DLC?</h4>
A. Demo and DLC downloads which do not include the base game are not currently included as
conversions for UTM links to the base game page. If a DLC package includes the base game it will be
counted as a conversion.
<h4>Q. Do you track conversion via in-game purchases?</h4>
A. We do not currently report conversion for in-game purchases.
<h4>Q. Do you track conversion via CD-Keys/Steam Retail Keys?</h4>
A. Yes, these conversions are tracked in the "Activations" section of the UTM Dashboard.
<h4>Q. Do you track conversions for playtest apps?</h4>
A. We do not currently report conversions for playtest apps.
<h4>Q. Do you support other community and store page links such as sub, curator, bundle?</h4>
A. At this time only app pages are supported. We hope to expand support for additional page types in
the future.
<h4>Q. Do UTM links get recorded if the store page opens an age gate?</h4>
A. Yes, the UTM click event is recorded for the app when the age gate page is shown. Customers who
decide to stop at the age gate are still recorded as having clicked the UTM link.
<h4>Q. What devices are supported?</h4>
A. Any device with a modern browser capable of showing the Steam store is supported. This includes
mobile devices and tablets. We do not currently display which types of devices customers are using
when they visit the store page via a UTM link click. If a user signs in to Steam on their mobile
device where they clicked the UTM link, then subsequently makes a wishlist or purchase on a computer
we will recognize that as a conversion.
<h4>Q. Why are my total visits different from the 3rd party reported number?</h4>
A. There can be a difference in the total visits reported by Steam and a 3rd party as Steam
increments the total visits anytime the customer visits the link with UTM params on the URL.
Examples include if customers share the Store page link w/UTM parameters for others to click, or
visit the link using their browser history. We're evaluating how we measure total visits and will
update this documentation if there are changes.
<h4>Q: Can I use UTM to create an “affiliate program” or reward players?</h4>
A: An affiliate program is where someone receives something of value in exchange for promoting your
game. Steam does not offer an affiliate marketing program, but some developers have asked about
creating their own by handling compensation outside of Steam and using UTM to track actions. We
would caution against using UTM parameters to create your own affiliate or reward program, as such
programs are susceptible to abuse by customers by holding purchases long enough to receive your
reward, and then refunding those purchases. This can be difficult to prevent because the UTM report
does not:<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        Reveal which purchases belong to which UTM parameters, only the total number of purchases
        for each unique set of UTM parameters<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Adjust totals for refunds occurring 4 days or later after the UTM visit. We consider the UTM
        visit fully processed at 4 days.
    </li>
</ul>
<br />
If you are still interested in creating your own affiliate program using UTM links to your Steam
store page, here are some rules to keep in mind:<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        Follow all applicable legal requirements. Note that legal requirements may vary by
        country.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Require from anyone who participates in your affiliate program that they disclose this fact
        to their audience. <br />
    </li>
    <li>Do not advertise affiliate programs on your game’s store page.</li>
</ul>
