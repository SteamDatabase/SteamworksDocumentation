<h1>Discounting</h1>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Overview</h2>
Discounting can be a valuable tool to help grow your audience and extend the life of your product on
Steam. You can participate in official sales events and take advantage of discounting tools to run
your own custom discounts.<br />
<br />
In general, we've found that there is a customer at every price point, and an effective discounting
strategy can contribute to overall long term success on Steam.<br />
<br />
As always, this advice is generalized for a huge variety of products, developers, and customers, so
take your own product and community into account when making decisions.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="2"></a>Configuring Discounts</h2>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="3"></a>Required Permissions</h2>
Discounting requires the "Manage Pricing &amp; Discounts" permission for the relevant product. In
addition, you must be a member of the Steamworks partner that is getting paid for the product you
are trying to discount.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="4"></a>How to Configure</h2>
<ol class="bb_ol">
    <li>
        Navigate to the new discounting dashboard here:
        <a
            href="https://partner.steamgames.com/promotion/discounts/dashboard/"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noreferrer"
            >https://partner.steamgames.com/promotion/discounts/dashboard/</a
        >
        (or select "Apps &amp; Packages -&gt; Discount Management")<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        On this page you will see a grid of the games you have pricing permission for and all
        upcoming sales that your games can participate in.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Simply enter a valid discount for each package and event as desired and click the 'save'
        button at the bottom of the page.
    </li>
</ol>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="5"></a>How to Edit a Discount</h2>
Discounts can be edited up until the discount itself has started. You can do so by visiting the same
dashboard URL as you used to create the discount and simply change the discount % you wish to set.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="6"></a>How to Delete a Discount</h2>
Discount can be deleted up until the discount itself has started. You can delete a discount by
visiting your discounting dashboard and entering the number 0 for the discount percentage. Click
'save' the same way you would when entering a discount and you will have removed that discount.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="7"></a>Types of Discounts</h2>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="8"></a>Self-Serve</h2>
Partners are able to create and manage the following discounts on their own. Any discount set to 20%
or greater will automatically trigger email notifications to players with your game on their
wishlist. Discounted titles are eligible to appear in various 'specials' sections throughout Steam,
based on your game's tags, popularity of your game, and to users that it is recommended.<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="9"></a>Launch Discount</h2>
    Launch discounts start once your title is released on Steam and can be staged to run for between
    7 and 14 days, ending at 10am Pacific on the applicable day. We generally suggest launch
    discounts around 10% to 15%, should you chose to set one. There is a limit of 40%. Launch
    Discounts are optional and are configured near your release date setting on your app landing
    page.
    <h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="10"></a>Weeklong Deals</h2>
    Weeklong Deals begin every Monday morning at 10AM Pacific time and run for 7 days.
    <h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="11"></a>Custom Discounts</h2>
    You can configure your own custom discounts to align with special events like a major update or
    the anniversary of your products's release. You can schedule a custom discount to begin on the
    following calendar day.
    <h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="12"></a>Themed Sales</h2>
    Steam organizes various themed sales events designed to showcase certain categories of games.
    These events will have specific criteria for eligibility, and a process of invitation,
    registration, and discounting. Each of these sales will be promoted on the homepage of Steam and
    organized into sub-categories relevant for each event.
    <a

        >Learn more here.</a
    >
    <h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="13"></a>Seasonal Sales</h2>
    There are four major seasonal sale events per year, which take over the Steam store experience
    in a big way. All games on Steam are invited to participate with a discount. These four events
    are Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter.
    <a

    >
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="14"></a>Curated</h2>
The following discount types are created and managed by Valve. When selecting products to fill these
front-page promotional slots, we consider games of all price points and genres. While there aren't
exact rules, as a base guideline we tend to focus on the most-played or best-selling games on Steam.
If your title qualifies for an upcoming curated slot, we will contact you with details. These
promotional slots aren't negotiated for or sold, they're just built around player data. If your game
has lots of happy customers and hundreds of thousands of revenue over past few months, feel free to
<a
    href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/wizard/HelpWithPublishing"
    target="_blank"
    rel="noreferrer"
    >contact us any time</a
>
to discuss promotion options,<br />
<br />
There are three main types of curated promo slots for products. The default discount length for all
three promo slots is one week, but we're happy to be flexible with shorter or longer discounts,
within our existing discount policies.<br />
<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="15"></a>Daily Deal</h2>
    Daily Deals are featured on the Steam homepage for 24 hours, and rotate every day at 10am
    Pacific. There are two or more Daily Deal slots per day. The artwork used for the Daily Deal is
    our standard "Header Capsule" 460px x 215px, and is imported from the associated game or bundle
    automatically. Daily Deal discounts run from 7 to 14 days.

        >Learn more here.</a
    >
    <h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="16"></a>Midweek Deal</h2>
    Midweek Deal promotions are featured on the Steam homepage for 72 hours, from Monday at 10am
    Pacific until Thursday at 10am Pacific. There are up to six Midweek slots per week. The artwork
    used for the Midweek promotion requires custom asset sizes detailed
    <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/assets/promos" class="bb_doclink">here</a
    >, which will be localized by Valve. Midweek discounts default to one week, but by publisher
    request we can run those discounts anywhere from 3 to 14 days.
    <h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="17"></a>Weekend Deal</h2>
    Weekend Deal promotions are featured on the Steam homepage for 96 hours, from Thursday at 10am
    Pacific until Monday at 10am Pacific. There are up to six Weekend Deal slots per week. Similar
    to Midweek promotions, Weekend Deals require custom asset sizes detailed
    <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/assets/promos" class="bb_doclink">here</a
    >, which will be localized by Valve. Weekend Deal discounts default to one week, but by
    publisher request we can run those discounts anywhere from 4 to 14 days.
    <h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="18"></a>Visual Example of Curated Deals</h2>
    Here's a sample display of the Special Offers carousel on the Steam homepage. Midweek and
    Weekend spotlights occupy the larger spaces on the left side. Daily Deals are on the right side.
    A user can page through this carousel, where they'll see multiple spotlights from curated sales,
    as well as other discounted products that are organically recommended based on current
    popularity with customers.

    <h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="20"></a>Free Weekends</h2>
    Free Weekends are promotions where customers have temporary access to your game. Users can try
    out the game for free, but lose access when the time period expires. This kind of offer is used
    strategically for certain types of games or circumstances, and is usually paired with a discount
    to help convert trial players to paying customers.

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="21"></a>Discounting Rules</h2>
<br />
Steam encourages partners to discount their products as best fits their marketing plans and product
strategies, but there are several specific discounting rules to keep in mind. <br />
<br />
A central motivation for these rules is to increase pricing transparency to customers. In general,
we try to improve customer communication by posting discounts on Steam that are either 1) in
reference to a base price that has been in place for at least 30 days, or 2) in reference to a bona
fide launch price that <i>will be</i> in place for at least 30 days after the conclusion of a
special introductory offer. <br />
<br />
Steam's specific discounting rules are as follows: <br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="22"></a>30-Day Discount Cooldowns</h2>
    A product cannot be discounted within 30 days of a prior discount, within 30 days of its initial
    release, or within 30 days of a price increase in
    <i>any</i>
    currency. These are commonly referred to as "30-day discount cooldowns." There are only two
    exceptions to the 30-day discount cooldown rules:
    <ul class="bb_ul">
        <li>
            A <strong>Launch Discount </strong>is an optional introductory offer which allows a
            product to be on discount at its initial release. Launch Discounts can only be set up
            prior to the product's release date, not after. Once a product's initial launch discount
            ends, the product cannot run <i>any</i> other discounts for 30 days. <br />
        </li>
        <li>
            A <strong>Seasonal Sale </strong> is a big Steam-wide sales event, such as the Summer,
            Autumn, Winter and Spring sales. Unlike other discounts, these do not have 30-day
            discount cooldowns, <i>and</i> they're exempt from the 30-day discount cooldown of other
            non launch discounts. This means a product can schedule a non-launch discount within 30
            days of a Seasonal Sale - either before or after - and still join the Seasonal Sale. A
            few notes on this exception: <br />
            <ul class="bb_ul">
                <li>
                    Only non-launch discounts get this exception. Any price increases, product
                    releases, or a product's initial launch discount (if any) will not get this
                    exception. <br />
                </li>
                <li>
                    This exception also only applies to the discount events created specifically for
                    the Seasonal Sales, which appear in the
                    <a
                        href="https://partner.steamgames.com/promotion/discounts/dashboard"

                    >
                    ahead of each sale. If you set up your own discount event around the same dates
                    as a Seasonal Sale, it wont get these exceptions. <br />
                </li>

        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="23"></a>Discounts &amp; Changes to Base Pricing</h2>
    It's not possible to increase or decrease the base price of a product during an active discount,
    or while a discount is scheduled in the future. It's also not possible to discount a product for
    30 days following an increase to the base price in
    <i>any</i>
    currency. See
    <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc//store/pricing" class="bb_doclink">Pricing</a>
    for more details and best practices on setting base prices.
    <h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="24"></a>Discount Thresholds &amp; Durations</h2>
    When setting up individual discounts, the following guidelines apply:
    <ul class="bb_ul">
        <li>
            It's not possible to discount a product by more than 95% or less than 10%. Launch
            discounts in particular cannot exceed 40%. <br />
        </li>
        <li>
            it's not possible to create a discount for a product that would result in the price in
            any currency falling below Steam's
            <a
                href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/3700310527377680732"

                rel="noreferrer"
                >Minimum Price Thresholds</a
            >. <br />
        </li>
        <li>
            Discounts cannot run shorter than 1 day or longer than 14 days. Launch discounts in
            particular cannot run shorter than 7 days or longer than 14 days.<br />
        </li>
        <li>
            If your product is included in any bundles, the bundle discount will be applied on top
            of any individual discounts applied to the bundled packages(s). See
            <a
                href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc//store/application/bundles"

            for details. <br />
        </li>
        <li>
            Any discount set to 20% or greater can automatically trigger wishlist notifications to
            players who've wishlisted your game. See

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="bestpractices"></a>Discounting Best Practices</h2>
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <h2 class="bb_subsection">
        <a name="26"></a>Keep in mind your product's sales decay curve and content offering
    </h2>
    Steam's
    <a href="https://partner.steampowered.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
        >Sales &amp; Activation reporting</a
    >
    has a lot of data, dashboards and downloadable .csv files to help you understand how your
    players, your sales and your revenue are evolving over time. This can help guide your discount
    strategy. For instance, it can be tempting to use small discounts in an attempt to climb the Top
    Sellers list or gain more exposure in the early days of your title, but look carefully at how
    many customers are purchasing your product at full price before entering a discount. It's
    important for customers to feel good about their investment, so it's probably best to use
    discounts once you've settled into the tail of your sales curve. Conversely, an older game in
    the "long tail" of its lifecycle, but otherwise one with good retention and a robust DLC
    catalogue, may consider steeper discounts on the base game in the hopes of creating a bigger
    potential audience for the DLC offerings.
    <h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="27"></a>Stairstep your discounts</h2>
    It's typically best to ease into discounting, and increase the level of discount over time. For
    example, a title might move from 33% to 50% to 66% to 75% and beyond over the course of a year
    or more. Rushing into a 50% or 75% discount weeks after your launch, or releasing with a very
    high launch discount, sends a bad message to customers who bought at full price and undermines
    the value of your title.
    <h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="28"></a>Time discounts to content updates</h2>
    When figuring out your discounting plan, try to make as big an event as possible, ideally tying
    the discount to a content update as well. While the discount can attract interest, it's even
    better to show you are committed to your community by improving your product with content
    updates.
    <h2 class="bb_subsection">
        <a name="29"></a>Discount all associated packages (DLC, Deluxe Editions) at the same time
    </h2>
    If your product has multiple editions or DLC, discount them all together. Discounting only part
    of your product, or putting the base game on sale this week and the Deluxe Edition next week,
    dilutes your exposure and prevents you from taking advantage of all the network effects of Steam
    that happen as more users get excited about your product at the same time. You might not want to
    match the discount on every package. For example, if one DLC is a year old, and the another just
    came out, it probably makes sense to choose a different discount percentage for each.
</ul>
<div class="bb_callout">
    <div>
        <strong>Note: Discount Stacking</strong><br />
        Please note that bundle discounts stack on top of any individual bundle component discounts
        that are occurring.
    </div>
</div>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="30"></a>Discounting Examples</h2>
<br />
Here are some common examples of the above discounting rules in action. For these examples, we'll
use an imaginary fishing game called Bass Ain't Bitin' 2 and follow it throughout its first year of
Early Access to its v1.0 Release. <br />
<br />
These examples aren't meant to be prescriptive. As always, partners set their own prices and
discounts and are encouraged to hone their approach within the guidelines outlined above. Rather
these examples are meant to illustrate how the various discounting rules fit together and interact
with each other, and how these interactions will need to be accounted for when planning your price
updates and discounts. <br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="31"></a>Example 1: Early Access Release</h2>
    Bass Ain't Bitin' 2 wants to launch into Early Access on November 10. It wants to do this with a
    launch discount and it also wants to join the Steam Winter Sale, which starts later in the year
    on December 17. To run both discounts, the game decides to set up a 7-day launch discount from
    November 10-16. Since there are 30 days in November, the 30-day discount cooldown created by the
    launch discount will end on December 16, allowing the game to join the Winter Sale discount
    event that begins on December 17.
    <ul class="bb_ul">
        <li>
            If Bass Ain't Biting 2 wanted to run a <i>14-day</i> launch discount instead of a 7-day
            launch discount, it could do that, but then it wouldn't be able to join the Steam-wide
            Winter Sale discount event on December 17 (because the 14-discount would end November
            23, which is only 23 days before the start of the Dec 17 Winter Sale). Remember,
            Seasonal Sales are only exempt from normal (non-launch) discount cooldowns.
        </li>

        <a name="32"></a>Example 2: Joining Multiple Featuring Events with One Discount
    </h2>
    Later next Spring, things are going well and Bass Ain't Bitin' 2 is invited to three featuring
    events in the month of June! These include a Fishing Fest which runs from June 10-14, an Indie
    Awards Showcase Event from June 18-20 and a Daily Deal on June 12. To do all this, Bass Ain't
    Bitin' sets up a single custom discount event to span all three events. It chooses June 10 - 20
    with a discount of 20%. This means the game will be featured at a 20% discount in all three
    featuring events, and the single discount event will only generate one 30-day discount cooldown.
    This cooldown would begin when the discount ended on June 20 at 10am Pacific and run until July
    20 at the same time of day.
    <ul class="bb_ul">
        <li>
            Suppose in this scenario that the Summer Sale was beginning on June 27. Bass Ain't
            Bitin' 2 could also join the Summer Sale discount event if it wanted to, because the
            Summer Sale is exempt from the 30-day cooldown created by custom discount events. <br />
        </li>
        <li>
            Uh oh! Suppose the Fishing Fest needs to be urgently rescheduled to June 1-4. In this
            case, Bass Ain't Bitin' would need to choose between being on discount for the Fishing
            Fest or for the Indie Awards Showcase Event. It can't be on discount for both, since the
            two featuring events would be more than 14 days apart and 14 days is the maximum
            duration for a custom discount. However, regardless of which one it chooses, It could
            still be featured in the other at its regular (non-discount) base price and it could
            still join the Summer Sale discount event on June 27.

            <strong>Featuring &amp; Discounts:</strong> A lesser known aspect of some featured Store
            pages, like Themed Fests or Showcase Events, is that a game can be featured in them with
            any discount event, or even with no discount at all. If a game is ever featured without
            a discount, that's fine, it'll be featured at its regular base price. <br />
            <br />
            Keep in mind, however, that's it's not possible to be featured at regular (full) price
            in placements that are specifically for discounts, such as a Weekend Deal or Seasonal
            Sale.

    <h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="33"></a>Example 3: Price Increase at v1.0 Release</h2>
    Bass Ain't Bitin' 2 has had a lot of big updates over its first year of Early Access, and it
    feels its ready for a price increase to account for all the new content that's been added to the
    base game. Its v1.0 release date (aka Early Access Graduation) is approaching on October 15, but
    it also wants to run one last custom discount during the early access window,
    <i>and</i>
    it also wants to run another launch discount for the v1.0 Release. How can it manage a price
    increase, a custom discount, a v1.0 release and a launch discount given the cooldown timers? One
    potential solution would be the following:
    <ul class="bb_ul">
        <li>
            On September 1st, Bass Ain't Bitin' 2 sets up a 14-day discount on its current Early
            Access prices. At the same time, it also announces that it intends to increase prices at
            the end of this sale. It's always a good idea to announce price increases ahead of time
            to give your community time to prepare. <br />
        </li>
        <li>
            This discount ends on September 14 and the game immediately raises prices in preparation
            for the upcoming v1.0 release. This means the 30-day discount cooldown from the custom
            discount overlaps with the 30-day discount cooldown from the price increase. In effect,
            the two 30-day discount cooldown timers run at the same time. <br />
        </li>
        <li>
            Then, 30-days later on October 14, both discount cooldowns end. The following day, the
            game releases into v1.0 on October 15 with a Launch Discount. <br />
        </li>
        <li>
            Alternatively Bass Ain't Bitin' 2 could have just as easily done its price increase 30
            days <i>after</i> the end of the launch discount, instead of 30 days before. It could
            have even increased prices right at V1.0 release, although this third option would have
            prevented it from running a launch discount due to the 30-day cooldown from the price
            increase. <br />
        </li>
        <li>
            Ultimately there is no one-size-fits-all solution to discounting. It's important to
            manage your discounts as best fits each game's unique content, community and marketing
            plans. More on this in

<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        <strong>Q: How are Steam curated promotions scheduled? Can we bring ideas to Steam?</strong
        ><br />
        A: Scheduling promotions has typically been a conversation between you and Steam. We may
        come to you with ideas, and if you feel you have an idea of a unique Curated Promotion,
        please contact us. But you can also set up your own discounts whenever works best for you,
        or you can opt into the regular weekly sales.<br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Q: Are promotions mandatory on Steam?</strong><br />
        A: No. We might invite you to take part in a special event or promotion, but there is
        nothing that you are required to participate in.<br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Q: How are discounts approved?</strong><br />
        A: For Curated Promotions, Valve will come to you with an idea for your approval if we think
        your title is a good fit for one of these promotions.<br />
        <br />
        For Self-Serve Promotions, once you set up your discount using our Discount tool, then your
        game will automatically go on sale at the date and time you specified.<br />
        <br />
        For detailed information about best practices with discounts, see
        <a href="#bestpractices" class="bb_doclink">Discounting Best Practices</a>.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Q: Can I update a discount?</strong><br />
        A: Yes, if your discount is not yet live, then you can edit or delete it.<br />
        <br />
        If you would like to adjust your Launch Discount, you can do so by going to your game's
        landing page and clicking the box next to the launch discount you have entered currently.<br />
        <br />
        If you would like to change a discount for an upcoming weeklong sale, custom discount or
        Steam-wide seasonal sale, then you can simply return to
        <a
            href="https://partner.steamgames.com/promotion/discounts/dashboard/"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noreferrer"
            >your discounting dashboard</a
        >
        and change the percentage you wish for any given discount. To remove a discount, just set
        the discount percentage to 0%.<br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Q: How often can I discount my game?</strong><br />
        A: Custom discounts must be spaced at least 30 days apart and at least 30 days after the
        release of your product on Steam. Custom discounts don't affect eligibility for Steam
        Seasonal Sales. Note that the 30-day cooldown for new releases and price increases still
        applies for the Steam Seasonal Sales.<br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Q. Will these new discount cooldowns apply to curated promotions too?</strong><br />
        A. Yes, discount cooldowns will apply to promotions like Daily Deals, Midweek Deals, Weekend
        Deals, Weeklong deals, publisher weekends, and any custom discounts. Any discount applied to
        a game must have 30 days between the end of one discount and the beginning of the next
        discount. The only exceptions to this cooldown are the four seasonal seasonal sales: Spring,
        Summer, Autumn, Winter.<br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Q: Is there a limit to how deeply I can discount a game?</strong><br />
        A: You can set a game discount up to 95% off the base price. However, the Steam store only
        supports a minimum unit sale of $0.49 USD or equivalent in each currency or region (see
        <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/pricing/minimums" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
            >Price Minimums</a
        >
        for a table of minimums per currency). As such, a discount on a package can only bring the
        discounted price down to $0.49 USD. Also, if you set prices below the suggested equivalent
        price in any currency or region, your discounts may be restricted by the minimum discounted
        price in that currency or region. If you wish to sell content below these limits, you are
        welcome to use the
        <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/features/inventory" class="bb_doclink"
            >Steam Inventory service</a

            >Q: Can I run a launch discount when transitioning from Early Access to fully
            released?</strong
        ><br />
        A. Yes, you may run a launch discount when transitioning from Early Access to fully
        released, unless you have increased your product's price within the last 30 days.<br />
        <br />

            >Q: My Early Access game is transitioning from Early Access to fully released with a
            launch discount? Can I join a seasonal sale within 30 days of the launch
            discount?</strong
        ><br />
        A: Yes. In this unique case, your game's base price has already been established place
        during its Early Access period, so the launch discount is treated as a standard discount
        instead, meaning it's 30-day cooldown will not block your game from joining a Seasonal Sale.
        However, keep in mind your game can still be blocked from joining a Seasonal Sale by other
        kinds of 30-day discount cooldowns, such as one from a price increase. <br />

        <strong>Q: I got a "Server Error" when saving. What does that mean?</strong><br />
        A: It may mean that you don't have permission to enter a discount for that specific game or
        package.<br />

        <strong
            >Q: Why isn't my discount displaying to customers with a strikethrough price or a
            prominent tag saying "X% Off?"</strong
        ><br />
        A: Discounts may display differently to customers in different parts of the world, per local
        laws. Please note that the discounted price is still used, it may just not be displayed as a
        strikethrough price in all territories. <br />

    <li>
        <strong>Q: I thought the cooldown was 28 days, not 30 days?</strong><br />
        A: As of January 1, 2023, the cooldown requirement has been extended from 28 days to 30
        days.
