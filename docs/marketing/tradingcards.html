Steam Community Items are collectible items that users can use to decorate their profile or express
themselves in Steam Chat. There are multiple ways users can acquire these items: crafting Trading
Cards into badges, trading directly with other users, purchasing the items directly off the Steam
Community Market, or by redeeming points in the Steam Points Shop.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="2"></a>Steam Trading Cards</h2>
Steam Trading Cards are collectible cards users get by playing games on Steam. By collecting the
entire set of cards, users earn items that help them customize their profile and show off
gameplay.<br />
<br />
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Collect cards</strong> - Users can play a participating game to get trading cards.
        Half the card set is received during gameplay (based on playtime in the game), the other
        half is earned through collecting (trading with or buying from other users through Steam and
        the Steam Community Market).<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Craft badges</strong> - A full set of cards can be crafted into a game badge that
        can be prominently displayed on the profile and the mini profile (seen when hovering on a
        user's avatar.)<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Get rewards</strong> - During badge crafting users receive random rewards from a set
        of game related items including emoticons, profile backgrounds, and coupons.
    </li>
</ul>

<h4>Eligibility</h4>
Trading cards are a profile feature that is offered to games that have met our player engagement
thresholds. See <a href="/doc/marketing/profile">Profile Features</a> for information on this topic.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="3"></a>Steam Points Shop</h2>
<br />
With the introduction of the
<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/points/howitworks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
    >Points Shop</a
>, there is now a more direct way for users to acquire these items. Users must own the product and
have at least two hours worth of playtime in it before they can redeem Steam Points for emoticons or
static profile backgrounds.<br />
<br />
<strong
    ><i
        >There is also a separate set of assets and items available for direct sale via Points Shop.
        You can add those items after you've already shipped Trading Cards. See
        <a href="/doc/marketing/pointsshopitems">Points Shop Items</a> for information on this
        topic.</i

The amount of trading cards must be between 5 and 15 cards, based on a theme for the game. Sets are
usually 6-9 cards, less for shorter games. For example, if there are 6 main maps for a game you
might do a set featuring the 6 maps, or character classes, weapon types, etc.<br />
<br />

<div class="bb_callout bb_blue">
    <div>
        NOTE: Steam will combine the standard card frame with the small image, game logo, and border
        color to create the cards. A preview will be displayed in the trading card admin page in
        Steamworks.
    </div>
</div>
<br />
A set of foil trading cards will also be automatically generated. Foil cards are rare and grant a
special foil badge. They are dropped the same way as regular trading cards.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="badges"></a>Badges</h2>
When a user collects the entire set of cards, they are able to craft a badge. There are 5 regular
badges and one foil badge. Level 1 requires collecting the set 1 time, and 5 times for Level 5. The
badges should increase accordingly in desirability and value. The foil badge is earned when the rare
foil set of cards is collected. This badge should have a special treatment worthy of the foil cards:
silver, platinum, shine, sparkle, etc.<br />
<br />
Badges are usually displayed on #1B1B1B colored backgrounds.<br />
<br />
For each badge (Level 1-5 and Foil), please provide the following images:<br />
<br />
<ul>
    <li>80x80px PNGs with a transparent background (shadow may be included).<br /></li>
    <li>Unique title for each badge</li>
</ul>

emoticons when crafting a badge.<br />

Free apps may only have trading cards if the app has in-app purchases. Users will get a card drop
for every $9 USD equivalent spent in the app.

After your assets are approved, you'll see the status update on your Steamworks home page. You’ll
then be able to set the release state to “Released” and publish the items.<br />
<br />
NOTE: Once the assets are published changes are only permitted for errors.
