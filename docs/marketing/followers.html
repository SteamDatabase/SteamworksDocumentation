<h1>Followers</h1>
Players can choose to follow your game by selecting the option from your store page. This action
allows your news and events to appear in the player's Friends Activity Feed and also within their
Steam News Hub.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>How to follow a game</h2>
Just below the screenshots on the game's store page, there is a button to follow the game.<br />
<br />

<br />
Following can also be done from the top of the game's community hub.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="2"></a>What following does</h2>
There are two specific things that happen for a player that follows your game:<br />
<ul>
    <li>
        When you post an event or announcement, those posts will appear in the activity feed for
        players that follow your game. Here is a link to your own activity feed for reference:
        <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/my/home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
            >https://steamcommunity.com/my/home</a
        ><br />
    </li>
    <li>
        When you post an event or announcement, those posts will appear in the News Hub for players
        that follow your game.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="3"></a>How to see the number of followers</h2>
When a player hits the button to follow your game, they are also technically joining a mostly hidden
game group. The only place we display this follower count is as 'members' of your game group. You
can see the follower count on the Manage Members page of your game: <br />
<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/<appid>/membersManage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
    >https://steamcommunity.com/games/&lt;appid&gt;/membersManage</a
>
for any given AppID. <br />
<br />
You'll need to be logged in to the Steam community with your developer account to access that
page.<br />
