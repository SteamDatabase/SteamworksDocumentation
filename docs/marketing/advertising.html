<h1>Advertising on Steam</h1>
Steam does not contain any paid advertising, nor are advertising models supported in games
distributed on Steam. There are varying interpretations for what constitutes ‘advertising’ in a
game, so the examples below are meant to help guide developers as to what is and is not supported on
Steam.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Supported</h2>
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        <h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="2"></a>Product Placement</h2>
        Games may contain real brands, products, personalities, etc as part of gameplay, provided
        such portrayals are not disruptive and are appropriate within the context of the game. For
        example, a racing game might feature real life sponsor logos on its race cars, or a
        skateboard game might include characters wearing real-world brands. Note that all developers
        must obtain the relevant permission and/or licenses for any copyrighted content contained in
        their games.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="3"></a>Cross Promotions</h2>
        Developers can run many different kinds of cross-promotional activities on Steam, such as
        bundles, sale events, and more. Promotions may involve other Steam products, or
        products/brands outside of Steam. These types of promotions are encouraged and many
        customers find value in them. However, under no circumstances is it okay to charge other
        developers to participate in a bundle or to sell access to a sale page or other page on
        Steam. <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="4"></a>Paid Advertising Outside Steam</h2>
        Developers may want to run paid advertising campaigns to drive traffic to their Steam
        product pages. We recommend taking advantage of

        and

        to help enhance and measure the effectiveness of any off-Steam campaigns.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="5"></a>Not Supported</h2>
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        Developers should not utilize paid advertising as a business model in their game, such as
        requiring players to watch or otherwise engage with advertising in order to play, or gating
        gameplay behind advertising. If your game's business model relies on advertising on other
        platforms, you will need to remove those elements before shipping on Steam. Some options you
        could consider include switching to a single purchase "paid app," or making your game free
        to play with optional upgrades sold via
        <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/features/microtransactions" class="bb_doclink"
            >Microtransactions</a
        >
        or
        <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc//store/application/dlc" class="bb_doclink"
            >Downloadable Content (DLC)</a
        >.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Developers should not use advertising as a way to provide value to players, such as giving
        players a reward for watching or engaging with advertising in their game.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Developers should not charge other developers for access to Steam features. These include
        sale pages, bundles, store pages, franchise pages, etc.
    </li>
</ul>
