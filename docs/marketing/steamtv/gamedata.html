You can augment your live stream with localized markups that describe interesting moments to
re-watch or moments for late comers to catch-up by watching. You do this by sending game data along
with your live video data. The game data can be sent from the same machine or a different machine
than the one used for live video data.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Upload</h2>
<br />
The Steam end-point to upload game data is the following:<br />
<br />
<div class="bb_code">
    https://&lt;rtmp hostname&gt;/broadcast/&lt;steamid of broadcaster&gt;/upload_gamedata
</div>
<br />
All of the parameters are supplied with POST.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="2"></a>Server Choice</h2>
You need to send game data to the same RTMP server that you will send the live video data to. The
game data should be sent after you have already begun your live stream otherwise you will receive
412 HTTP status code. If you are getting 412 even though the live stream is running, it means you
are sending the game data to a different RTMP server than the video data which may be caused by
using a DNS round-robin URL for the RTMP. By looking at the
<a href="http://steamcommunity.com/broadcast/upload/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
    >steamcommunity.com/broadcast/upload/</a
>
page, you want to use the explicit RTMP server as pointed to by the green arrow to ensure that the
live video data and game data are going to the exact same RTMP server. The other table (red arrow)
is a DNS round-robin of RTMP servers located in the same geographic region; using this may result in
the game data going to a different server than the video data. <br />

<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="3"></a>Example</h2>
Using the above as an example, I would send my live video stream to
<a href="http://rtmp:/br1-sea1.broadcast.steamcontent.com/app" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
    >rtmp:/br1-sea1.broadcast.steamcontent.com/app</a
>
and my game data to
<a
    href="https://br1-sea1.broadcast.steamcontent.com/broadcast/76561198348711414/upload_gamedata"
    target="_blank"
    rel="noreferrer"
    >https://br1-sea1.broadcast.steamcontent.com/broadcast/76561198348711414/upload_gamedata</a
>
where '76561198348711414' is my steamid which I use for live streaming.<br />
<br />
We recommend you send your game data to this API every 2-5 seconds. The game data can be a complete
representation from the beginning of the streaming event.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="4"></a>POST Parameters</h2>
All of the parameters are required<br />
<ol class="bb_ol">
    <li>
        <strong>appid</strong> : The app being streamed. If this appid changes with subsequent calls
        we will clear cache of any previous game data. <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>rtmptoken</strong> : this is the stream key or the RTMP token you received from
        <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/broadcast/upload" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
            >steamcommunity.com/broadcast/upload</a
        >. This is the same RTMP token used to permit you to upload your live video data.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>gamedata</strong> : JSON game data. The format is described in the next section.
        Make sure to encode via base64
    </li>
</ol>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="5"></a>Game Data Format</h2>
<br />
<div class="bb_code json">
    { "appid": 220; "brackets": { "name": "#bcast_TeamVsTeamMap", "start": 1536104722301, // time is
    in seconds from epoch, Jan 1, 1970 "end": 1536107426249, // optional parameter; Supply when you
    know the bracket's end. We auto close a bracket if you open a new one. "params": { // optional
    parameter; used when localizing your strings "team1": "Alpha", "team2": "Beta", "map": "dust2"
    }, }, "markers": { "time": 1536107426249, "name": "round 1", // optional parameter; Only shows
    as a tooltip when a user hovering over the tick marker. "params": { "loctoken": "loc token" },
    }, }
</div>
<br />
The string used for <strong>'name'</strong> can optionally be tokens for localization (as in the
example above). The parser will replace the token with the translations for each language; English
is used as the fallback language if the customers language is not provided. There are no general
localize tokens. You must define the tokens via the Rich Presence for the app. You can edit your
Rich Presence in App Data Admin for your app. The above example would have the following
localization in the apps Rich Presence in the following way: <br />
<br />
<div class="bb_code">
    "#bcast_TeamVsTeamMap" "%team1% vs %team2% | {#gamemap_%map%}" "#gamemap_dust2" "Dust 2"
</div>
<br />
This would display on screen the following: 'Alpha vs Beta | Dust 2'<br />
<br />

To see how CSGO thinks about the game data integration, you can look at this document. They can
configure their CSGO game client to send game state data to any web server. They show an

    >https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Counter-Strike:_Global_Offensive_Game_State_Integration</a

to receive the data.<br />
<br />
Here is an example of the code that CSGO team used to upload the brackets and markers to Steam
Broadcast (not complete example, just the upload code segment):
