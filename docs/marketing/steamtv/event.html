        1920x1080 splash screen that includes the logo for the event, to be shown when the stream is
        inactive. An example, is from the
        <a

    </li>
    <li>A broad schedule (days for main event, group stage etcâ€¦)<br /></li>
    <li>What time of day will the streaming start? Is that the same each day?<br /></li>
    <li>
        The number of parallel streams and the SteamID that will be used to broadcast those streams
        (we need to white list them)<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        If there are parallel streams, what are their purpose, so that we can describe them in
        drop-downs<br />

            <li>Parallel matches?<br /></li>
            <li>Are they different language streams?<br /></li>
