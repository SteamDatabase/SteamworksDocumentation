<h1>Sale Page Editor - Store Page Banners</h1>
Store Page Banners are special event banners that can appear across the top of a game's store page,
just below the product name. Here is some information on how those banners work and how to set them
up.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Types of banners</h2>
There are three ways that banners can appear on the top of a game store page, and they function
differently. Here are some details.<br />
<br />
<ol>
    <li>
        <strong>Game Update Banner</strong>: A banner that comes from an individual update event and
        opens the event details over the game's store page<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Sale Event Banner</strong>: A banner that comes from participation of that game on a
        sale page. Clicking this banner would go to the sale page.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Halloween Banner</strong>: There is a special Halloween banner that can appear on
        the top of participating games' store pages during the Steam Halloween sale
    </li>
</ol>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="2"></a>Game Update Banner</h2>
A banner that comes from an individual update event and opens the event details over the game's
store page. This is useful when a single game has big news or a big update that we want to amplify
on that game's store page.<br />
<br />

/>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="3"></a>User Experience:</h2>
Clicking on this banner would open an event details panel that floats over the rest of the game page
content. The player can scroll the panel, read the news, interact with links, etc. Or simply close
the news and be back on the store page for the game.<br />

/>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="4"></a>Uses:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        If we're promoting a big update to a game, say via a takeover or IM, then we want the update
        news to be obvious and easy to open on the store page<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Even if we're not promoting it, a game may have a huge update that is their biggest news of
        the year and they want to make a big deal of it
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="5"></a>Setting up:</h2>
<ol>
    <li>The partner must first create an event of any type other than "Cross Promotion"<br /></li>
    <li>
        Then, the partner must upload a 'Library Spotlight' image to that event. By default, this
        image will be set to appear in the library page for the game just below the 'play' button.
        But it can be disabled by toggling the switch right above the banner image in the event
        editor.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Once the banner image is provided, Valve can enable showing the banner by toggling an option
        under the 'options' tab.<br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        The banner will then appear on the top of the game page starting with the 'start visibility'
        date of the event, and ending after two weeks.
    </li>
</ol>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="6"></a>Sale Event Banner</h2>
A banner that comes from participation of that game on a sale page. Clicking this banner would go to
the sale page. This is useful when running an event with multiple games that you want to link back
to a sale landing page.<br />
<br />

    title="FriendshipGamesWeekBanner.png"
/>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="7"></a>User Experience:</h2>
The banner will appear on all of the games included on the sale page. When a player clicks on the
banner, it will take them to the sale page
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="8"></a>Uses:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        If running a publisher weekend and want all the included games to link back to the main
        event<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        If running a franchise sale and want all the included games to link back to the main
        event<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        3rd party event organizers often set up a banner so the included games will link back to the
        main event page
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="9"></a>Setting up:</h2>
<ol>
    <li>
        Valve must first enable the sale page feature under a Steam Community Group (usually be
        their publisher/developer/franchise page) : Create New Sale Page Wizard<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Once a sale page is set up, "Store page banner" assets can be added to that sale page
        (requires both desktop and mobile versions)<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        If those assets are uploaded, then we'll show the banner on store pages for all included
        games<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        The banner will start with the start visibility date set for the sale page, and end two
        weeks later, or with the end of the associated sale page.
    </li>
</ol>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="10"></a>Halloween Event Banner</h2>
During the Steam Halloween sales event, you may see a special Halloween banner that appears on the
top of the store page for each participating game. This special banner is enabled by Valve and only
lasts during the Steam Halloween Sales event. Clicking the banner will take players back to the
Halloween sale page.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="11"></a>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<strong
    >Q. What if there are multiple banners that could show up on a game's store page? Which one will
    appear?</strong
><br />
A. There are three possible banners that can appear at the top of a store page. Here is the order of
priority.<br />
<ol>
    <li>
        During the Steam Halloween sale, we sometimes show a special banner on participating games.
        This will always take priority during the Steam Halloween sale.<br />
    </li>
    <li>A Game Update Banner will take next priority<br /></li>
    <li>
        An event organized under the linked developer or publisher homepage will take next
        priority<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        If there are multiple Sale Event Banners, then Steam will show the one with the latest valid
        start date
    </li>
</ol>
<br />
<strong
    >Q. What if my game is listed on a sale page and I don't want the banner on my store
    page?</strong
><br />
A. We don't have controls yet for hiding the banner from specific game store pages. If your game is
part of a sales event that has a store page banner enabled, it will appear on all the participating
games' store pages.<br />
