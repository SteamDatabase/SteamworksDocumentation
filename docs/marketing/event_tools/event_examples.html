<h1>Events and Announcements Examples</h1>
As part of the Steam Library update, we’ve improved the look and feel of your event and announcement
pages, along with the authoring tools for creating them. Below is an example of one of these
revamped event pages, and how it will appear under your page’s Recent Updates.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Cover Image</h2>
<strong>A portal to your event/announcement.</strong><br />
<br />
The <strong>cover image</strong> asset is used to represent your event/announcement in a number of
places across Steam, including on the store page for your game and in the Steam Client Library. It's
used to link to your event/announcement and may be displayed alongside content from multiple games,
so the image should be clear and recognizable.<br />
<br />
Alongside the cover image, Steam will always include your game's name and icon, so you do not need
to include this information within the image. Instead, it is recommended that the image concisely
represents your announcement, including any announcement specific graphics or branding. Example: to
take a specific event like TI6, Valve would create a cover image focusing on "The International"
rather than a generic use of "Dota 2".<br />
<br />
Example cover images:<br />

/>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="2"></a>Event/Announcement Detail Page</h2>
<strong>The guts of your event/announcement.</strong><br />
Users will click through the <strong>cover image</strong> (described above) to read the Event Detail
page. <br />
<br />
<br />
There are two primary parts to the Event Detail page:
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="3"></a>Event Header</h2>
An <strong>event header image</strong> can be provided for each event or announcement that you post.
This graphic is optional but increases the prominence of your major updates. If provided, the
graphic should include images and logos/branding related to your update.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="4"></a>Event Body</h2>
Users can interact with the <strong>event body section</strong> of your announcement. So, in
addition to text and static images, feel free to include Steam Store widgets or YouTube videos.<br />
<br />

/>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="5"></a>Steam Library - Game Details Page</h2>
Your game details page in the Steam Library includes three image types to convey information about
the state of your game.<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li><strong>Hero image</strong> - Reflects the branding/art for your game<br /></li>
    <li>
        <strong>Featured Event</strong> - You can "Feature" an important event/announcement for your
        users, which causes it to appear at the top of your library page with a special formatting
        to stand out.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Patch Notes</strong> - Patch Notes are shown in a more compact format to convey
        their less prominent status.
    </li>
</ul>
<br />
<br />

<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="6"></a>Hero Image and Game Logo</h2>
The <strong>hero image</strong> supplied for your game will act as the branding/header for your game
details page and as a visual anchor representing where a user is within the Steam Client. Users will
expect this image to be consistent, recognizable, and an accurate representation of your game's
brand. Therefore it should not include any text or other messaging related to most events or
announcements. In most cases, to alert the user to new information, you'll want to use the
<strong>spotlight image</strong> described below.<br />
<br />
In the rare case, you may want to change your hero image to reflect
<strong>major changes in your game</strong>. Some scenarios for updating your library hero image
are:<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>major content update<br /></li>
    <li>the start of a new game season<br /></li>
    <li>addition of a new game character<br /></li>
    <li>a long running seasonal event (a multi-week Halloween or Christmas update)</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="7"></a>Cover Image</h2>
Your <strong>cover image</strong> is reused alongside the event Title and Summary when displaying
previous events/announcements in the user's Activity Feed. <br />
