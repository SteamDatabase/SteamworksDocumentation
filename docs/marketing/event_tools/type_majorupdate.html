<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>What is a Major Update?</h2>
Major Updates are designed for use in communicating your biggest game updates and signaling to
players that this is one of the biggest moments in the year for your game.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="2"></a>Major Update Visibility</h2>
Major update type events can appear in all the regular places, including store page, community hub
and Steam Library. These posts will show up to players that follow your game and will qualify to
show up in the "What's New" section for your fans at the top of the Steam Library homepage.<br />
<br />
<ol class="bb_ol">
    <li>
        <strong>Library "What's New" section</strong> - This section appears at the top of the Steam
        Library to show players what's happening in the games they play. The visibility of your
        event here will vary slightly from player to player depending on which games they play, how
        recently, how much they play, and personalization settings they have set.<br />

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="3"></a>Posting Major Updates</h2>
To post about your major update, visit your app's landing page in Steamworks and scroll down to
"Post/Manage Events &amp; Announcements". Clicking that option will take you to a screen to select
the type of event you wish to post. You can click on "A Game Update" to expand the options and then
select "Major Update".
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="4"></a>Minimum Requirements</h2>
Major Updates are designed to be prominent and exciting posts, intended to get your player base
excited about new content added to the game. With that in mind, you'll want to prepare a bit more
content for your post ahead of time.<br />

Beyond these minimum requirements, you may want to craft the body of the post itself to include lots
of images, video, and rich description of the update. You can use BBCode to format your post, and
our tools support a number of ways of embedding interesting content within the post.<br />
