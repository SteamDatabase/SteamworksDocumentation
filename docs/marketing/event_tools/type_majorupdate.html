<h1>Event Type: Major Update</h1>
Within the Steam Events &amp; Announcements tools, there are three levels of category for game
updates, which each work a little differently: Patch Notes, Regular Updates, and Major Updates. For
details on Patch Notes, please see

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>What is a Major Update?</h2>
Major Updates are designed for use in communicating your biggest game updates and signaling to
players that this is one of the biggest moments in the year for your game.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="2"></a>Major Update Visibility</h2>
Major update type events can appear in all the regular places, including store page, community hub
and Steam Library. These posts will show up to players that follow your game and will qualify to
show up in the "What's New" section for your fans at the top of the Steam Library homepage.<br />
<br />
<ol>
    <li>
        <strong>Library "What's New" section</strong> - This section appears at the top of the Steam
        Library to show players what's happening in the games they play. The visibility of your
        event here will vary slightly from player to player depending on which games they play, how
        recently, how much they play, and personalization settings they have set.<br />

content for your post ahead of time.<br />

Beyond these minimum requirements, you may want to craft the body of the post itself to include lots
of images, video, and rich description of the update. You can use BBCode to format your post, and
our tools support a number of ways of embedding interesting content within the post.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="build"></a>SteamPipe Builds and Patch Notes</h2>
When submitting a new build for your game via SteamPipe, a small prompt will automatically appear to
encourage you to also post a patch note for your customers. This prompt lets you easily submit your
patch notes inlines at the point after submitting the build. Often developers will use this to write
a bullet point list of the changes made. Patch notes following your build updates is helpful for
your customers to realize you are continuing work on and improve your game.<br />
