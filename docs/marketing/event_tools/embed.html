<h1>Embeddable Widgets</h1>
Here are the list of URLs that will transform into widget when your fans read your events or
announcement. Simply write the URL in a plain fashion, and they will automatically convert when the
event is shown in the store, community or library. You can see them when you preview your event to
ensure that the URL is well formatted.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="youtube"></a>YouTubeâ„¢</h2>
YouTube URL in the following format will automatically transform into an embed that shows the poster
image, view count and short summary. When a user interacts with the player, it will expand and
provide them the native YouTube controls.<br />
<br />
<div class="bb_code">
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=&lt;video id&gt; youtu.be/&lt;video id&gt;
</div>
<br />
For example, using the Video ID of 'UUn-ET4vv1s' we would see the following widget in your event.<br />
<br />
<img
    src="https://cdn.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/2019-09-17_8-17-04.png"
    alt="2019-09-17_8-17-04.png"
    title="2019-09-17_8-17-04.png"
/><br />
<br />
Note: With YouTube, we have a few additional formatting options via the [previewyoutube] tag
accessible via the toolbar's import YouTube icon.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="store"></a>Store Product Page</h2>
Inserting the URL for your Steam store product page will inject a widget that will let users
wishlist (if coming soon), buy or play (if free-to-play) your game right from the event page. This
is useful when promoting upcoming or launched DLCs. <br />
<br />
However, this should be used sparingly, as events will also appear to your existing fan in the
library, who already have your game in their library. While great to announce new DLC over a short
time; always placing your game at the footer of the event will likely annoy your fans.<br />
<br />
<div class="bb_code">https://store.steampowered.com/app/&lt;appid&gt;</div>
<br />
Below is an example of how
<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/620" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Portal 2</a> will
render when inserting the URL into a Steam news post:<br />
<br />
<img
    src="https://cdn.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/2019-09-17_8-26-30.png"
    alt="2019-09-17_8-26-30.png"
    title="2019-09-17_8-26-30.png"
/>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="workshop"></a>Workshop and Community Items</h2>
Inserting a link to any workshop item or community item (artwork, screenshot, game guide etc...)
will render as a clickable widget your event or announcement. This is a great way to highlight and
sharing the great contributions your community is making about your game.<br />
<br />
<div class="bb_code">https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=&lt;file id&gt;</div>
<br />
For example, here are a few examples from Portal 2's
<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/620/workshop/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Workshop</a>
and <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/620" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Community Hub</a>.
You can find the URLs needed by clicking the item in the Hub and going to their page, or by clicking
the "Share" button on any item in the Steam Community.<br />
<br />
<img
    src="https://cdn.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/2019-09-17_8-44-09.png"
    alt="2019-09-17_8-44-09.png"
    title="2019-09-17_8-44-09.png"
/>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="events"></a>Preview Events and Announcements</h2>
<br />
Similar to community items, you can insert a link to a previously published event or announcement.
This is great way to link the previous posting that is part of a series or another type of past
event that is related to the current event. <br />
<br />
<div class="bb_code">
    https://steamcommunity.com/games/&lt;appid or vanity&gt;/announcements/detail/&lt;gid&gt;
    https://steamcommunity.com/ogg/&lt;appid&gt;/announcements/detail/&lt;gid&gt;
    https://steamcommunity.com/gid/&lt;official game group's 64-bit
    steamid&gt;/announcements/detail/&lt;gid&gt;
</div>
<br />
You can find the URL by hitting the 'Share' button on that previous event. It is perfectly fine to
cross list to an event of another game too. Here is an example of the first
<a
    href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/portal2/announcements/detail/92679896001484067"
    target="_blank"
    rel="noreferrer"
    >Portal 2 update event</a
>.<br />
<br />

    alt="2019-09-18_13-59-10.png"
    title="2019-09-18_13-59-10.png"
/>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="medal"></a>Medal.tv</h2>
<br />
It might be fun to share an epic moment from your gaming sessions in your game's announcements. One
way is to embed a short clip via Medal.tv; it becomes instantly playable, loopable and further
shareable by your fans.<br />
<br />
<div class="bb_code">https://medal.tv/clips/&lt;clip id&gt;</div>
<br />
You can grab a clip by hitting copy link from the clips page. Here is an example of what this
<a href="https://medal.tv/clips/4725198" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">clip</a> embedded on an
events page looks like<br />
<br />
Medal offers customization options to add things such as a "Get this on Steam" button to your clips.
You can view the clip documentation
<a href="https://docs.medal.tv/player#enable-get-this-on-steam" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
    >here</a
>.<br />
<br />
<img
    src="https://cdn.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/2019-09-18_16-41-17.png"
    alt="2019-09-18_16-41-17.png"
    title="2019-09-18_16-41-17.png"
/>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="sketchfab"></a>Sketchfab</h2>
<br />
It is possible to share awesome 3D models that the development team or that your community have
created in a way that is easily explorable by your fan. We use a service called Sketchfab to host
the models and to render them into the browser for people to explore. <br />
<br />
You can simply put the URL to the model directly into the event body.<br />
<br />
<div class="bb_code">
    https://sketchfab.com/models/&lt;model id&gt;
    https://sketchfab.com/models/7b08add6fb40478a9bc465a8ef0d8ffb
</div>
<br />
That would automatically generate a summary block about the 3D model in the event description. This
summary includes the items name and authors name.<br />
<br />
<img
    src="https://cdn.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/2020-03-05_17-48-05.png"
    alt="2020-03-05_17-48-05.png"
    title="2020-03-05_17-48-05.png"
/><br />
<br />
Then when a user clicks on the summary it will expand into an interactive 3D item explorer. The
explorer will let the user zoom and rotate the model and jump to other models that the author has
created. Great way to share ideas with your community.<br />
