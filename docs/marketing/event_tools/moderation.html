<h1>Events and Announcements Review Step</h1>
When an event or announcement is first posted or updated, it goes through a quick routine review
step by Valve moderators. Until a post has been reviewed and confirmed, the post will not be visible
in the Steam Library, including on the Library homepage and on the game's Library detail page.

The review period typically takes an hour, with many posts reviewed within 30 minutes.

necessary mature content settings are appropriately applied.<br />
