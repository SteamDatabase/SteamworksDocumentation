<h1>Sale Page Tools - Background Groupings</h1>
Background groupings allows you to configure background visuals that span one or more section of
your sale page. These backgrounds span the full width of the page, and let you apply various
formatting of images and/or gradient colors.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Before you start</h2>
In order to make use of this feature, you will need to:<br />
<ul>
    <li>
        Review the <a href="/doc/store/promo">rules and guidelines</a> for the type of event you are
        running.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        At the bottom of each rules page, find the link under "Getting started" and submit a support
        ticket with information about your event.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Once enabled, you'll need to add your games, configure sections and finish most of the
        merchandising work to organize the games in your sale.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Flip over to the 'preview' of your sale page, and you'll see the controls to enable
        background groupings.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="2"></a>Using the Background Groupings</h2>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="3"></a>Enabling Groupings</h2>
To start using groupings, you'll need to be in preview mode of your sale page. Then select "Enable
Groupings" in the upper-right corner. You will see some additional UI appear with further options.
<br />
<br />
You can de-select the "Edit mode" checkbox to hide the editor UI if you need cleaner preview of your
work.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="4"></a>Adding New Groupings</h2>
Groupings are possible starting with the first content section of your sale page. This assumes that
you are already using the sale page background and sale logo to style the top-most area of your sale
page.<br />
<br />
To define a new grouping, click the button "Add Another Group". This will create a group that
contains the first section of your sale page. Once this exists, you'll see a button to "Configure
Background".
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="5"></a>Background Configuration Options</h2>
Each grouping can contain one or more section of content, and can have a background configured in a
few different ways.<br />
<ul>
    <li>
        Background Gradient - you can select one solid color, or two colors to generate a gradient
        background color, and you can choose which direction the gradient should go<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Background Image - You can upload one big image, or a smaller image with the intention of
        repeating horizontally, vertically, or both.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="6"></a>Adding Sections to a Grouping</h2>
Once you have defined a background grouping, you'll see a button to move the next content section
into that grouping. Use that button to move any subsequent sections into your grouping that you wish
to be presented in front of the same background.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="7"></a>Removing a Background Grouping</h2>
You can only remove the last background grouping on the page. For the last grouping, you will see a
button that says "Remove this group".
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="8"></a>Background Grouping With Tabs</h2>
Groupings will always end above a 'tab' section if present on your page. Any sections below the
tabs, including the tabs themselves, will require a background grouping to be defined for each
selected tab.
