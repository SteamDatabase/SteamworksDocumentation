<h1>Sale Page Section: Apps And Bundles</h1>
The cornerstone of sale page functionality is the ability to display games and bundles. The "Apps
&amp; Bundles" section is critical for defining a list of products to display and how they should
appear on your page. You will most likely have multiple sections of this type that are populated
with different sets of games.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Setting Up: Linked App List</h2>
If your sale contains more than about 20 games, you may want to use the Linked App List to define
the full set of games to include on your page. Once you have done that, you can then use specific
filter criteria within each "Apps and Bundles" section to display different sets of games.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="2"></a>Adding games</h2>
To use the Linked App List, simply scroll to near the top of your sale page editor, find the section
named Linked App List, expand the section, and begin adding games. You can add games one at a time,
or you can use the "Edit Raw" button to paste in a list of appIDs.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="3"></a>The sync process is important</h2>
As you add games to your linked app list, the sale editor tool will pull in associated metadata
about each game, such as whether it has a demo, a discount, or is coming soon. It also pulls in the
current list of tags on the game. However, the data about a game can change over time as they
release demos, start discounts, or update tags. You will need to click the "Sync" button in order to
update the metadata stored within your sale event.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="4"></a>Options for adding games to a section</h2>
You need to define the set of games or bundles to show in each section, and there are three
different ways you can approach that.<br />

<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="5"></a>1. Smart section (requires a linked app list)</h2>
This is a set of options that will populate an app section using some pre-defined criteria. This is
most often used to personalize the display of games for each user visiting your page, for example by
showing the player games that are part of this event that are on their withlist or are recommended
to them by Steam. Once you enable Smart Section, you will see a few options for which smart section
criteria to use for this section.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="6"></a>2. Using filters (requires a linked app list)</h2>
If you have more than about 50 games, and if you want to organize them by genre or tag, you may want
to use the linked app list. With this method, you define the set of games at the top of the sale
page editor tools and then use filters for app sections to display different sets of titles for each
section.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="7"></a>3. Directly adding games</h2>
The most simple way to display games within a app section is to add them individually to the section
itself. To do this, find the "Add Individual Apps" area. You'll either type in the game name or
appID and select the game from the drop-down.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="8"></a>Options for display of games</h2>
These options can be combined in a variety of ways to achieve the look you are going for.<br />

<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="10"></a>Display as a grid</h2>

for how to display that single item.<br />
