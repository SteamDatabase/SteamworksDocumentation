<h1>Sale Page Section: Tabs</h1>
If you have an event with more than 50-100 games, you probably want to split the content up into
different tabs. You can use tabs to organize your page by genre, category, theme, or any other way
that makes sense for the games included in your event.<br />

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Tabs as Filters</h2>
Once tabs are enabled, you can use each tab to filter content by applying a filter setting on the
tab configuration itself.<br />
You can specify individual tags as filters, or you can use certain features. Here are a few
examples:<br />
<table>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <th>Filter Name</th>
            <th>Function</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>[Feature] HasDemo</td>
            <td>
                Will filter down to only show base games that have a valid, visible demo available
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>[Feature] Discounted</td>
            <td>Will filter down to only show games that have an active discount running</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>[Feature] VR</td>
            <td>Will filter down to only show games that support VR</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>[Feature] Free</td>
            <td>Will filter down to only show free and free to play games</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>[Feature] Coming Soon</td>
            <td>Will filter down to only show unreleased games</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
