<h1>Sale Page Livestreaming (Broadcasting)</h1>
See <a href="/doc/resources/Sales_Feature_Beta">Sales Landing Page Editor</a> documentation for more
on setting up sale page.<br />
<br />
--<br />
<br />
Any sale page can support livestreaming, either from the games included on the sale page, or from
specific Steam accounts added to an approval list. Note that Steam generally uses the terms
"Livestream" and "Broadcast" interchangeably.<br />
<br />
For more information on setting up a livestream itself, please see
<a href="/doc/store/broadcast">Steam Broadcast Documentation</a><br />

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Enabling Broadcasts</h2>
By default, broadcasting is disabled on sale landing pages, but can easily be enabled by switching
to the "Broadcasting" tab and ticking the "on" option.<br />
<br />
This Broadcast tab enables you to approve and prioritize specific Steam accounts for their
livestreams to appear first in your broadcast section on your page.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="2"></a>Configuring Location of Broadcast Player</h2>
By default, broadcasts will appear at the very top of your sale page. But you can add a 'broadcast'
type section to your page (further instructions below) to display livestreams in a specific spot on
your page (if, for example, you wish to show more information above the broadcast player). This
'broadcast' type section will automatically include livestreams from games that are part of your
sale and from specific accounts that you approve.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="3"></a>Displaying Multiple Livestreams</h2>
When a sale page has more than one active livestream, the player will change format to show a list
of available streams on the left of the video player. It will default to show the small capsule for
the game being broadcasted and then show a screenshot from the live broadcast when the user hovers
over it. This allows Steam customers to quickly browse through available live broadcasts.<br />

<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="4"></a>Prioritization order</h2>
When a person visits your sale page, the Broadcast player will choose a livestream to show based on
the following logic:<br />
<ol>
    <li>
        Broadcasts from Steam accounts explicitly added on the "Broadcast" tab and set to priority
        "Primary"<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Broadcasts from either of these sources:<br />
        <ul>
            <li>
                Steam accounts explicitly added on the "Broadcast" tab and set to priority
                "Featured"<br />
            </li>
            <li>
                Broadcasts who have a current live slot in the Event Schedule widget (if a schedule
                widget is included in the sales events) are treated as equal to "Featured" above

                    >Learn more about the event schedule sale section.</a
                >
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Broadcasts from Steam accounts explicitly added on the "Broadcast" tab and set to priority
        "Default"<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Broadcasts from either of these sources:<br />
        <ul>
            <li>
                Broadcasts from Steam accounts explicitly added on the "Broadcast" tab and set to
                priority "General"<br />
            </li>
            <li>Any Official Broadcast associated with a game featured on the Sale page.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>
<br />
If there are two or more broadcasts in any of the prioritization buckets, then Steam randomly picks
one from within the prioritization bucket. This at least provides a fair distribution of viewers.<br />
<br />
The capsules are presented in descending order by priority bucket and by viewer count within each
priority bucket.<br />
