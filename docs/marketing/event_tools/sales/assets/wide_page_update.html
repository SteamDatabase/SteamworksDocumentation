<h1>Wider Sale Pages Coming October 6th</h1>
We've got an important change coming to sale pages following the Steam Autumn Sale.<br />
<br />
Plus, we've recently added support for external UTM links to pass through sale pages to the
individual games, so there is a quick description of that feature below as well.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>New max page width: 1200px</h2>
<br />
<strong>Starting October 6th, 10am Pacific Time</strong><br />
<br />
On October 6th, at the conclusion of the Autumn Sale, we'll be adjusting the general width of sale
pages on Steam, allowing the content to scale up to a maximum of 1,200 px wide now. This may impact
your sale page if your background art relies on the center column of content being exactly the
previous 940px wide.<br />

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="2"></a>Sale page UTM support</h2>
<br />
If you have external links pointing to your sale page, you can now mark up those links with UTM
parameters and Steam can now track those through to conversion such as wishlisting and purchase.
<br />
<br />
UTM reporting is only visible to the developers or publishers of each game. This added support does
not provide any additional reporting for event organizers - it merely passes UTM parameters through
from external sources to the individual games.<br />
<br />
Other third-party events such as showcases, themed sales, or regional events can also add UTM
parameters to any external URLs you are using to promote your event. In that case, the developers of
participating games will be able to look at their own UTM reports to see conversions on their games
that originated with your external links.<br />
<br />
If you use different UTM parameters for different posts you make, you can more easily see the impact
of each of your posts and how they convert to actions such as wishlisting or purchasing.<br />
