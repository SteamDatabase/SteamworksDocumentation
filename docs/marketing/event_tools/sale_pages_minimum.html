Sales page Events are made up of two parts: <br />
<ol>
    <li>
        <strong>The announcement</strong> - This is the part of the event that shows up as 'news' on
        your group's page and in the News Hub for any users that follow your group or developer
        homepage.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>The landing page</strong> - The sale event page itself that features the games,
        broadcasts, and/or events that you configure.
    </li>
</ol>
