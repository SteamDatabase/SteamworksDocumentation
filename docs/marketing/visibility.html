<h1>Visibility on Steam</h1>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Overview</h2>
Prominent visibility of products on the front page of the Steam Store is a careful balancing act. We
want to show products that customers are interested in buying and are going to be happy with, while
also giving new games and software a chance to find their audience.<br />
<br />
Ultimately, we aim to optimize for happy customers. There are definitely more changes and
improvements to this process in the works, but what follows below is a look at how things currently
work.<br />

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="2"></a>Early Access Launch Visibility</h2>
When your product launches in Steam <a href="/doc/store/earlyaccess">Early Access</a>, it will
appear in a couple places in the Steam store. This is a great time to make sure that you are
spreading word about your product through as many external channels as well to reach potential
customers wherever they are. The amount of exposure your title gets on Steam will depend on how
customers are responding to your product by purchasing, playing, reviewing, and other such
factors.<br />
<br />
Your game or software will appear in a couple of places:<br />
<ul>
    <li>In the "All New Releases" tab in the Early Access section.<br /></li>
    <li>
        If any people have your title on their wishlist, they may receive an e-mail notification of
        its release.
    </li>
</ul>
<br />
Additionally, your title may appear in some other places:<br />
<ul>
    <li>
        It may be recommended to specific users in various sections of the home page based on those
        users' preferences and tastes.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        It may appear on the "New and Trending" section on the
        <a
            href="https://store.steampowered.com/genre/Early%20Access/"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noreferrer"
            >Early Access</a
        >
        page if the title is doing well.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        It can appear on 'top sellers' list on the store home page and on relevant genre and tag
        pages if it has achieved sales rank.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="3"></a>Releasing Out of Early Access</h2>
Once your title transitions out of Early Access, it is treated the same as a title releasing fully
for the first time and the visibility guidelines below apply.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="4"></a>Full Release Launch Visibility</h2>
At launch, your game or software will appear in a couple of places:<br />
<ul>
    <li>
        The first thing that happens is your title will start appearing in the 'New Releases queue'
        and on the New Releases page for users. This provides a baseline of views against which to
        measure customer interest. See Baseline Visibility below for details.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Your title will also appear on the All New Releases list, which is linked from the Steam
        home page.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        If any people have your title on their wishlist, they may receive an e-mail notification of
        its release.
    </li>
</ul>
<br />
Additionally, your title may appear in some other places:<br />
<br />
It may be recommended to specific users in various sections of the home page based on those users'
preferences and tastes.<br />
It may appear on the "New and Trending" section on the home page if the title is doing well. Your
title may be bumped off this list quickly if many other popular products are releasing at the same
time.<br />
It can appear on 'top sellers' list on the store home page and on relevant genre and tag pages if it
has achieved sales rank.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="5"></a>Baseline visibility</h2>
As a baseline, your product will appear to customers in the 'New Release' queue when released fully.
Here's how it works:<br />
<br />
<ul>
    <li>
        As soon as your product releases, it is added to a pool of titles that have also just
        released.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Each time a logged-in Steam user visits the 'New Releases Queue', the system generates a
        queue from that pool, prioritizing the titles that have the least amount of views since
        release.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Depending on each users' preferences, your title may not be included in a queue. Titles can
        be filtered out based on associated tags or the type of product it is.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        When the user then clicks through their 'New Releases Queue', they will land on your store
        page and it counts as a view in our system.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="6"></a>Organic visibility</h2>
If your product is doing really well, it may get bumped up into the Main capsule on the front
page.<br />
<br />
Your title will also get additional, organic visibility along the way. Your title may appear on "New
and Trending" lists on the front page or on genre or category pages. It can appear on various "Top
Sellers" lists if achieved. It can appear on "Specials" sections if you are running a discount. And
it will appear in friends' activity feeds as customers make purchases, share screenshots, earn
achievements, and discuss the product. Your title might be recommended by Steam Curators or appear
in the Discovery Queue.<br />
<br />
Any visibility your title may have in these other places is in addition to the visibility generated
through Launch Visibility and Update Visibility Rounds features.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="7"></a>Key Visibility Elements</h2>
Which things matter most in making your game more visible within the Steam store? Here are a few of
the most important:
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="8"></a>Players and Purchases Matter</h2>
Are people buying and playing your game? This is a strong signal to Steam that there is interest in
your game and that Steam should try showing it to more players. For best results, make sure that
players know your game is coming and are excited to purchase and play the game.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="9"></a>Language Matters</h2>
Players prefer to play games that they can understand. For this reason, Steam will be more likely to
show your game to players that speak a language supported by your game. Translating your game into
more languages will make your game accessible and enjoyable to more players. For more information on
localization and languages, please see
<a href="/doc/store/localization">Localization and Languages documentation</a>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="10"></a>Tags Matter</h2>
Steam categorizes games by using a tagging system. You'll need to apply tags to your game during
your store page setup process. If you have an older game on Steam, you may want go back and go
through the tagging wizard to make sure your game has complete set of tags to accurately describe
the elements, themes, and genres of your game. For more on tags, please see
<a href="/doc/store/tags">Steam Tags documentation</a>.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="11"></a>Wishlists (Mostly) Aren't a Factor</h2>
With a few exceptions like the Popular Upcoming tab, wishlists are <strong>not a factor</strong> in
your game's algorithmic visibility on Steam. However, wishlists are still important. Customers who
wishlist your game will receive an email notification when your game launches or transitions out of
Early Access, or when your game is discounted at 20% or greater.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="12"></a>Store Page Traffic Doesn't Matter</h2>
The traffic landing on your store page is <strong>not a factor </strong>in your Steam store
visibility. More users landing on your page may result in additional sales, which can impact your
visibility, but traffic alone doesn't matter.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="13"></a>Conversion Rate Doesn't Matter</h2>
The conversion rate of users landing on your store page and making a purchase is
<strong>not a factor</strong> in visibility on Steam.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="14"></a>Review Score (Mostly) Doesn't Matter</h2>
As long as your game's reviews are Mixed or above (40%+), review score is
<strong>not a factor</strong> in algorithmic visibility. If your game dips below 40% into Mostly
Negative, your game will be less likely to be featured.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="update"></a>Update Visibility Rounds</h2>
When you make major updates to your application, add new content, release new DLC, or ship new
features, is a great time to remind new and existing customers about your product. We've built a
feature for doing exactly that.<br />
<br />
With Update Visibility Rounds, we've dedicated space on the front page of the Steam store to
highlighting products where the developer has a major update they would like to tell customers
about. These appear to customers that have your game in their library or on their wishlist.<br />
<br />
For more details, please see
<a href="/doc/marketing/visibility/update_rounds">Update Visibility Rounds</a> documentation.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="15"></a>Main Capsule Visibility</h2>
<br />
This area features games and software from a variety of sources and also allows for
user-customization to exclude or include particular types of content. By default, the main capsule
can include one or more popular new releases, top sellers, Early Access titles, personalized
recommendations, software, or DLC for products the user has in their library. This section is driven
by what players spend time and money on, rather than Valve curation. We want to show players what
they are interested in. The main capsule is different for every customer. It’s based on games they
own, games they play, games their friends play, top sellers, etc. You may see a certain game here
but another friend of yours won’t see it.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="16"></a>Tracking Your Visibility</h2>
With a personalized and dynamic store, it’s hard to tell where your game might be showing up and how
customers are finding their way to your product page.<br />
<br />
To address this we’ve introduced Steam’s new traffic data analytics. With this data, you can see
where your game is appearing, how many times it has been shown, and how those impressions have
translated into visits to your product page.<br />
<br />
Of course this data is all anonymous, but it should give you a good idea of where your game is
appearing and how many customers are clicking on those placements to get to your product page.<br />
<br />
To dive into your traffic data analytics, please visit the 'Marketing &amp; Visibility' section for
your product in the Steamworks website and click on the 'Traffic Breakdown' tab for details. You can
also follow this link for a high-level overview of all traffic across all the games in your catalog:

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="17"></a>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<strong>Q. Can I use an Update Visibility Round for my DLC launch?</strong><br />
A. DLC items do not have their own visibility rounds the way that base games or software titles do.
So when you launch a DLC that you want to promote through a visibility round, you will need to use
one of your base application's rounds.<br />
<br />
The way we suggest doing this is by posting an announcement in your community about your DLC launch,
and then use an Update Visibility Round to highlight your game or software. You can use the short
description to describe your DLC launch.<br />
<br />
This way, new and existing customers will be taken to your base application page where they can
learn about your product and also see any other DLC that is currently available for your product.<br />
<br />
<strong>Q. When can I start using Update Visibility Rounds?</strong><br />
A. You must wait until after your initial launch visibility has concluded before you can start using
Update Visibility Rounds. If you are in Early Access, you must wait two weeks after launch before
starting an Update Round.<br />
<br />
<strong>Q. How often can I use an Update Visibility Round?</strong><br />
A. There is no limit to how much time must be between the use of your Update Rounds. You may use
them all immediately one after the other if you wish. However, you may want to consider the future
plans for your game or software to anticipate future updates that you may want to save an update
round for.<br />
<br />
<strong>Q. Do I need to coordinate with a product update?</strong><br />
A. Yes, these appear in a section called "Recently Updated" and are intended for use when announcing
major updates to your application such as new content, new DLC, or new features.<br />
<br />
<strong>Q. How do I know where my game is showing up?</strong><br />
A. Steam traffic data analytics show you the specific areas (or 'feature') on each page in Steam
where your game has been shown to someone, how many impressions have occurred in each placement, as
well as where and how many times customers have clicked to get to your store page.<br />
<br />
<strong>Q. How can I get my game to show up to more customers?</strong><br />
A. Steam automatically shows games to customers in different ways and many different places. The
visibility of any given game on Steam is based on many factors, including how customers are reacting
to that product, and who the potential audience is for that product. Not every customer is
interested in every game, so Steam works to figure out who your game should be recommended to and
who is most likely to purchase your game.<br />
<br />
<strong>Q. Does this change how I release my game?</strong><br />
A. The release process for you is still the same, but now your game may be able to appear in more
places throughout Steam. You focus on making an awesome game and describe it accurately to customers
on your store page and Steam will work to show your game in appropriate places based on customers’
interests, preferences, and feedback.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind that you still need to make sure you get word out about your game as you lead up to
your release date. Get the community excited and build an audience. Put up a 'coming soon' page, and
post announcements. Some customers may need to see your game dozens of times before it catches their
attention.<br />
<br />
<strong>Q. Can I pay for my game to show up to more customers?</strong><br />
A. Nope. You focus on making a compelling, interesting, and unique game, and Steam will work out the
best places to feature your game based on customers’ interests, preferences, and feedback.<br />
