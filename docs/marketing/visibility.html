<h1>Visibility on Steam</h1>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Overview</h2>
Prominent visibility of products on the front page of the Steam Store is a careful balancing act. We
want to show products that customers are interested in buying and are going to be happy with, while
also giving new games and software a chance to find their audience.<br /><br />Ultimately, we aim to
optimize for happy customers. There are definitely more changes and improvements to this process in
the works, but what follows below is a look at how things currently work.<br /><br /><a

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="2"></a>Early Access Launch Visibility</h2>
When your product launches in Steam Early Access, it will appear in a couple places in the Steam
store. This is a great time to make sure that you are spreading word about your product through as
many external channels as well to reach potential customers wherever they are. The amount of
exposure your title gets on Steam will depend on how customers are responding to your product by
purchasing, playing, reviewing, and other such factors.<br /><br />Your game or software will appear
in a couple of places:<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>In the "All New Releases" tab in the Early Access section.<br /></li>
    <li>
        If any people have your title on their wishlist, they may receive an e-mail notification of
        its release.
    </li>
</ul>
<br />Additionally, your title may appear in some other places:<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        It may be recommended to specific users in various sections of the home page based on those
        users' preferences and tastes.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        It may appear on the "New and Trending" section on the
        <a
            href="https://store.steampowered.com/genre/Early%20Access/"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noreferrer"
            >Early Access</a
        >
        page if the title is doing well.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        It can appear on 'top sellers' list on the store home page and on relevant genre and tag
        pages if it has achieved sales rank.
    </li>
</ul>
<br />Once your title transitions from Early Access to fully released, the visibility guidelines
below applies
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="3"></a>Full Release Launch Visibility</h2>
At launch, your game or software will appear in a couple of places:<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        The first thing that happens is your title will start appearing in the 'New On Steam' queue
        and on the New on Steam page for users. This provides a baseline of views against which to
        measure customer interest. See Baseline Visibility below for details.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Your title will also appear on the All New Releases list, which is linked from the Steam
        home page.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        If any people have your title on their wishlist, they may receive an e-mail notification of
        its release.
    </li>
</ul>
<br />Additionally, your title may appear in some other places:<br /><br />It may be recommended to
specific users in various sections of the home page based on those users' preferences and tastes.<br />It
may appear on the "New and Trending" section on the home page if the title is doing well. Your title
may be bumped off this list quickly if many other popular products are releasing at the same
time.<br />It can appear on 'top sellers' list on the store home page and on relevant genre and tag
pages if it has achieved sales rank.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="4"></a>Baseline visibility</h2>
As a baseline, your product will appear to customers in the 'New on Steam' queue when released
fully. Here's how it works:<br /><br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        As soon as your product releases, it is added to a pool of titles that have also just
        released.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Each time a logged-in Steam user visits the 'New on Steam Queue', the system generates a
        queue from that pool, prioritizing the titles that have the least amount of views since
        release.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Depending on each users' preferences, your title may not be included in a queue. Titles can
        be filtered out based on associated tags or the type of product it is.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        When the user then clicks through their 'New on Steam Queue', they will land on your store
        page and it counts as a view in our system.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="5"></a>Organic visibility</h2>
If your product is doing really well, it may get bumped up into the Main capsule on the front
page.<br /><br />Your title will also get additional, organic visibility along the way. Your title
may appear on "New and Trending" lists on the front page or on genre or category pages. It can
appear on various "Top Sellers" lists if achieved. It can appear on "Specials" sections if you are
running a discount. And it will appear in friends' activity feeds as customers make purchases, share
screenshots, earn achievements, and discuss the product. Your title might be recommended by Steam
Curators or appear in the Discovery Queue.<br /><br />Any visibility your title may have in these
other places is in addition to the visibility generated through Launch Visibility and Update
Visibility Rounds features.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="update"></a>Update Visibility Rounds</h2>
When you make major updates to your application, add new content, release new DLC, or ship new
features, is a great time to remind new and existing customers about your product. We've built a
feature for doing exactly that.<br /><br />With Update Visibility Rounds, we've dedicated space on
the front page of the Steam store to highlighting products where the developer has a major update
they would like to tell customers about. These appear to customers that have your game in their
library or on their wishlist.<br /><br />Updates announced in this way are also displayed on the
Recently Updated page, where customers can see all recently updated titles or filter to just titles
they have bought or activated on Steam.<br /><br />You can use these rounds regardless of whether
your product is in Early Access or fully released.<br /><br /><i
    >NOTICE: Update visibility rounds will typically not show up during major seasonal sale events
    such as the Steam Summer Sale, due to storefront display changes during the sale events.
</i>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="6"></a>How this works</h2>
<ol class="bb_ol">
    <li>
        When you have a major update that you'd like to communicate to customers, simply click the
        'Start Update Round' button on your applications' Marketing admin page.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        You will be prompted to enter a short description and select a recent community announcement
        where customers will be able to learn more about your update.<br />
    </li>
    <li>When you get everything entered in, you're ready to start.<br /></li>
    <li>
        Your product will be added to a pool of titles that are opted in, and randomly selected to
        appear each time a customer views the home page until your visibility round ends.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Each visibility round will appear on the front page of Steam for up to 30 days. The number
        of impressions and clicks will depend on how many customers your game has and how many users
        have your game on their wishlist.<br />
    </li>
    <li>Your product and announcement will also be displayed on the Recently Updated page.</li>
</ol>

<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="7"></a>How To Start An Update Round</h2>
You can start an update visibility round once your initial launch visibility has concluded. To start
a round:<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        Select your product from your Steamworks home page to go to that product's landing page<br />
    </li>
    <li>On the product landing page in Steamworks, click "Marketing &amp; Visibility"<br /></li>
    <li>
        There, you will see a section for "Product Update Visibility Rounds" where you can start an
        update round
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="8"></a>Five Rounds to Start</h2>
Each product will start with five rounds that can be used for this visibility. These five rounds are
shared between Early Access and full release, so if you use them all during Early Access, you won't
have any available for major updates after your product has fully launched.<br /><br />Additional
rounds may be granted to products that are selling well.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="9"></a>Main Capsule Visibility</h2>
The main capsule (the large carousel at the top of the Steam home page) has traditionally been a
curated spot. With the Steam Discovery Update on 9/22/2014, this spot has turned in to a more
flexible space that can better suit the needs of a growing Steam catalog and userbase.<br /><br />This
area now features games and software from a variety of sources and also allows for
user-customization to exclude or include particular types of content. By default, the main capsule
can include one or more popular new releases, top sellers, Early Access titles, personalized
recommendations, software, or DLC for products the user has in their library.<br /><br />For more
details on this visibility and others across Steam, please see the Steam Discovery Update
announcement page.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="10"></a>Tracking Your Visibility</h2>
With a personalized and dynamic store, it’s hard to tell where your game might be showing up and how
customers are finding their way to your product page.<br /><br />To address this we’ve introduced
Steam’s new traffic data analytics. With this data, you can see where your game is appearing, how
many times it has been shown, and how those impressions have translated into visits to your product
page.<br /><br />Of course this data is all anonymous, but it should give you a good idea of where
your game is appearing and how many customers are clicking on those placements to get to your
product page.<br /><br />To dive into your traffic data analytics, please visit the 'Marketing &amp;
Visibility' section for your product in the Steamworks website and click on the 'Traffic Breakdown'
tab for details.<br /><br /><img

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="11"></a>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<strong>Q. Can I use an Update Visibility Round for my DLC launch?</strong><br />A. DLC items do not
have their own visibility rounds the way that base games or software titles do. So when you launch a
DLC that you want to promote through a visibility round, you will need to use one of your base
application's rounds.<br /><br />The way we suggest doing this is by posting an announcement in your
community about your DLC launch, and then use an Update Visibility Round to highlight your game or
software. You can use the short description to describe your DLC launch.<br /><br />This way, new
and existing customers will be taken to your base application page where they can learn about your
product and also see any other DLC is that currently available for your product.<br /><br /><strong
    >Q. When can I start using Update Visibility Rounds?</strong
><br />A. You must wait until after your initial launch visibility has concluded before you can
start using Update Visibility Rounds. If you are in Early Access, you must wait two weeks after
launch before starting an Update Round.<br /><br /><strong
    >Q. How often can I use an Update Visibility Round?</strong
><br />A. There is no limit to how much time must be between the use of your Update Rounds. You may
use them all immediately one after the other if you wish. However, you may want to consider the
future plans for your game or software to anticipate future updates that you may want to save an
update round for.<br /><br /><strong>Q. Do I need to coordinate with a product update?</strong
><br />A. Yes, these appear in a section called "Recently Updated" and are intended for use when
announcing major updates to your application such as new content, new DLC, or new features.<br /><br /><strong
    >Q. How do I know where my game is showing up?</strong
><br />A. Steam traffic data analytics show you the specific areas (or 'feature') on each page in
Steam where your game has been shown to someone, how many impressions have occurred in each
placement, as well as where and how many times customers have clicked to get to your store page.<br /><br /><strong
    >Q. How can I get my game to show up to more customers?</strong
><br />A. Steam automatically shows games to customers in different ways and many different places.
The visibility of any given game on Steam is based on many factors, including how customers are
reacting to that product, and who the potential audience is for that product. Not every customer is
interested in every game, so Steam works to figure out who your game should be recommended to and
who is most likely to purchase your game.<br /><br /><strong
    >Q. Does this change how I release my game?</strong
><br />A. The release process for you is still the same, but now your game may be able to appear in
more places throughout Steam. You focus on making an awesome game and describe it accurately to
customers on your store page and Steam will work to show your game in appropriate places based on
customers’ interests, preferences, and feedback.<br /><br />Keep in mind that you still need to make
sure you get word out about your game as you lead up to your release date. Get the community excited
and build an audience. Put up a 'coming soon' page, and post announcements. Some customers may need
to see your game dozens of times before it catches their attention.<br /><br /><strong
    >Q. Can I pay for my game to show up to more customers?</strong
><br />A. Nope. You focus on making a compelling, interesting, and unique game, and Steam will work
out the best places to feature your game based on customers’ interests, preferences, and feedback.
