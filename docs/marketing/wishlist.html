        <h5>In Brief</h5>
        Players can add your game to their wishlist on Steam to keep track of games they are
        interested in. When your game releases or goes on discount, those players automatically
        receive a notification.
        <h5>Level of integration</h5>
        None required, aside from creating your store page.

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Overview</h2>
Once your game has a publicly visible store page listed within Steam, players may begin adding your
game to their wishlist. Prior to the release of your game, this gives you a place to point your fans
and interested players where they can take action to express their interest and keep track of your
game. Along the way, this gives you a sense of the level of interest by potential customers and a
way of notifying interested customers when your game releases or goes on discount.<br />

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="2"></a>Wishlist Notifications</h2>
Email notifications may be sent to customers based on a variety of trigger actions related to your
game, software, or video on Steam. These triggers may change in the future, but this is a
description of current set of features.<br />
<br />
Discount e-mails typically send within a few hours of your product's release or discount. In high
volume e-mail periods, time to notification will be longer. <br />
<br />
Customers who have been notified about your game within the last 1-2 weeks (including "now
available" e-mails from product launches) will be on e-mail cooldown, and will not receive
additional communication until the cooldown period has passed. This period may be extended in
periods of high notification traffic (such as Steam seasonal sales).<br />
<br />
Note that customers must have verified their e-mail account to receive messages, and that some
customers may have opted to configure their e-mail preferences to not receive some or all of these
kinds of e-mails.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="3"></a>Product Launches (Release or Early Access)</h2>
When your game releases, either in Early Access or as Full Release, any user that has the game on
their wishlist at that time will receive an e-mail and/or mobile push notification about the game
being available.<br />
<br />
If your game has released in Early Access and then transitions to Full Release, another e-mail will
be sent to users with the game on their wishlist at that time.<br />
<br />
For more information on preparing for release, please see the
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/releasing" class="bb_doclink">Release Process</a>
documentation.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="4"></a>Promotional Discounts</h2>
When you run a discount on your game, a notification e-mail or mobile push notification will be
issued to users with your game on their wishlist, as long as you meet the following criteria:<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        Any type of discount at or above 20%, whether a curated feature spot, a weeklong deal, or a
        custom configured discount <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Discounts must, at a minimum, affect the lowest priced package for a game. For example, if
        you have a $20 Regular and $30 Deluxe package for your game, just discounting the the Deluxe
        package would not trigger wishlist notification e-mails, you would also need to discount the
        Regular package. <br />
    </li>
    <li>Discounts must be over 8 hours in duration<br /></li>
    <li>
        Note: if an email is held up for over a week for whatever reason, we will stop trying to
        send that email.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="5"></a>Your Wishlist Data</h2>
Within each app's details page on the
<a href="https://partner.steampowered.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
    >Sales &amp; Activation Reports Portal</a
>, you'll find a section for "Wishlists". This section tracks additions, purchases, and deletions by
users that have your game on their wishlist. Additionally, you can see a breakdown of wishlist
numbers by region or country in the "Regional sales report" section for each app. Wishlist data is
updated daily for the previous date (ie. as of March 2nd, you can see all of the data up to March
1st).<br />
<br />
You can also find some past analysis of wishlist behavior written up in the Steamworks Developer

time.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="6"></a>Best Practices</h2>
Here’s our three biggest suggestions:<br />
<ol class="bb_ol">
    <li>
        Put up a Coming Soon page as soon as you’re ready and able, so interested customers can add
        your product to their wishlist and get notified at launch.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Stay engaged over time—don’t just launch your game and move on to the next one. Many users
        will wait for a reason to buy your title, such as a transition out of Early Access, a
        content update, discount, or a friend to play the game with.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Look back at Wishlist data after a sale or promotional event to guide your future decisions.
        Trends over time can help you determine what communication is generating the most interest,
        both in terms of purchases and wishlists.

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="7"></a>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<h4>Q: How long after trigger are e-mail notifications sent?</h4>
<strong>A:</strong> E-mail notifications may be sent out over multiple hours depending on how many
users the system needs to send to. Additionally, notification emails may include several titles,
depending on how many a customer has on their wishlist.
<h4>Q: Is there a cooldown on how often an email is sent for a particular product?</h4>
<strong>A:</strong> Yes, there is a 1-2 week cooldown between wishlist emails. This can be extended
during periods of high traffic (like seasonal sales).
<h4>Q: Where can a user configure their e-mail preferences?</h4>
<strong>A:</strong> From the upper-right corner in Steam, select your user name to activate the
drop-down and select "Account Details." From there, you can select "Manage Email Preferences" to
pick which types of communication you wish to receive.
<h4>Q: Will all customers receive wishlist notifications?</h4>
<strong>A:</strong> Only customers who have verified their email address with Steam will receive
notifications.
<h4>Q: How do I track activity from email notifications?</h4>
<strong>A:</strong> If an email notification is sent for your title, visits to your store page will
be visible by going to “Marketing &amp; Visibility” -&gt; ”Traffic Breakdown” on your App Landing
Page.<br />
<br />
Additionally, you can monitor e-mail campaigns and conversion rates by going to the financial
reporting site, clicking “View detailed wishlist breakdown” and scrolling to the bottom of the page.
It will show you e-mail notifications sent during the selected time period.
<h4>Q: How do Wishlists affect my game’s visibility on Steam?</h4>
<strong>A:</strong> Wishlists can be an important factor in determining where your game appears on
Steam. After a user has wishlisted your game, your game may appear in different featured sections,
with a visual reminder that the game is on their wishlist. Prior to launch, your game may appear on
lists featuring upcoming games according to various filters, such as release date, popularity, tag,
or other categories. Additionally, when your game launches and goes on sale, Steam may send reminder
emails or other notifications to users that have wishlisted it. In general, Steam is designed to
offer a personalized view to each player. Whether a game appears in sections like the Recommended by
Tag or Curator, Interactive Recommender, Top Sellers, or Just Updated sections depends on what games
the user likes, plays, where they're located in the world, what language they prefer, what their
friends are playing, if they follow any Steam Curators, and so forth. The Steam store is
context-based and personalized for each user based on many different factors.
<h4>
    Q: Is there a minimum number of wishlists my game must have before Steam starts showing my game
    to users?
</h4>
<strong>A:</strong> No.
<h4>Q: Users have wishlisted my game. Now what?</h4>
<strong>A:</strong> Wishlists indicate interest from users as a result of the
marketing/awareness-building you did both prior to and after releasing your game. Did you just
stream your game and reveal your launch trailer on social media? You'll likely see an increase in
wishlists. Is your game released, and you’re running a sale to go with your big update? Not only are
you likely to see purchases from existing wishlisters, but also additions from players that are
seeing your game for the first time. Maybe those players are waiting until they have time to play,
or for a holiday or birthday, or maybe they’re waiting for a discount at a price that works better
for their buying habits or budget. <br />
<br />
Because everyone wishlists for different reasons, there’s no formula to accurately predict sales
from wishlists. Nevertheless, wishlists are valuable, and are the result of other work you are doing
to grow the potential audience for your game at release and beyond.
<h4>Q: How can I see Wishlists grouped by region or country?</h4>
<strong>A:</strong> On the app details page on the
<a href="https://partner.steampowered.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
    >Sales &amp; Activation Reports Portal</a
>, you'll find a section for "Wishlists". This section tracks additions, purchases, and deletions by
users that have your game on their wishlist. Additionally, you can see a breakdown of wishlist
numbers by region or country in the "Regional sales report" section for each app.<br />
