<h1>Features And Tools, Marketing</h1>
Steam works a bit differently than other stores in that we don't organize our store around paid ads.
In fact, we don't sell marketing space at all. Instead, the store is personalized for each player
based on what they are playing. Any curated promotional visibility is the result of proven customer
interest.<br />
<br />
So, how does your game get shown to players in the Steam store? This document talks about the tools
and features you can use in Steam to build awareness and audience in the weeks and months leading up
to release, get the most out of your buzz and excitement on release day, and how to keep players
engaged long after release. For information on how automatic visibility works on Steam, please read
<a href="/doc/marketing/visibility">Store Visibility documentation</a>.<br />
<br />
This document is broken down into features and tools that you can use at each stage of your game
development:<br />

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>New to Marketing? Need a refresher?</h2>
There are many entire books written on marketing and we're not going to try to go into that level of
detail here. In a nutshell, marketing is often thought of as a combination of Product (what is your
game?), Position (how is your game different from other offerings?), Price (What value does your
game offer for the price you are asking?), People (Who is your audience? Who would be interested in
your game?), and Promotion (What compelling offer or awareness can you make to reach different
portions of your audience?). <br />
<br />
Check out our <a href="/doc/marketing/bestpractices">Marketing 101 guide</a> for some useful
definitions and tools to help you think about what your game is, who its for, and how it fits in
among other games and entertainment being offered today. Much of this advice comes from talks we've
given at Steam Dev Days. Check out all the

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="2"></a>Pre-release Marketing</h2>
Lets assume you have the basics figured out. You know what game you are building, how it fits among
other games, and who it is for. (if not, check out our
<a href="/doc/marketing/bestpractices">Marketing 101 guide</a> for a refresher and some
suggestions). Here are some tools and resources that you might want to consider for helping you
along your way.<br />
<br />
<ul>
    <li>
        <h3>Your Store Page</h3>
        One of the most powerful things you can do is create a home for your product where
        interested players have an action they can take. By setting up your Steam store page early,
        you'll have a place where fans can learn about your game, add it to their wishlist, and will
        automatically get notified when you get to release day. Use your store page to tell the
        story of your game and get to the point as quickly as possible. <br />
        <br />

        <br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Wishlists &amp; Notifications</h3>
        When players add your game to their wishlist, they will automatically get an e-mail when you
        hit the 'release' button and in the future when you run a discount on your game. For this
        reason alone, it's really useful to put up your 'coming soon' store page as soon as you are
        far along enough with your game to be able show off screenshots and describe the core of
        your game.<br />
        <br />

        <br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Tag your game</h3>
        Once you've got your store page set up, be sure to visit the page and add any additional
        relevant tags. Just click the "+" symbol next to the set of tags already applied (from the
        set of genres you picked during setup) and you'll see an interface that allows you to choose
        and enter other tags. Look around at other games like yours and see what tags are in use
        that are also relevant to your gameâ€“they might be thematic, gameplay, art style, or
        sub-genres. These tags help our recommendation engine and also provide information to
        players about what your game is like.<br />
        <br />
        Note that you as the developer can also remove tags if players have tagged your game with
        something incorrect. Just click the little flag next to the tag in the tagging interface.<br />

        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Steam Next Fest</h3>
        Steam Next Fest is a multi-day celebration where fans can try out demos, chat with
        developers, watch livestreams, and learn about upcoming games on Steam. For developers,
        Steam Next Fest is an opportunity to get early feedback from players and build an audience
        for a future launch on Steam. Steam typically hosts three editions of Steam Next Fest each
        year, which take place in February, June, and October.<br />

        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Announcements</h3>
        During development, leading up to release, and throughout the life of your game, you'll find
        the Steam Events and Announcements system to be a useful channel for keeping your players
        informed and gathering feedback. Use it to post development progress, share new artwork
        creations, or describe interesting features you are working on. <br />
        <br />
        Learn more: <a href="/doc/marketing/event_tools">Events and Announcements Tools</a><br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Store Widget</h3>
        If you have your own website for your game and want to provide a handy link and synopsis of
        your game, you can use the store widget. This creates a little preview that you can embed on
        other websites and includes the price, artwork, and call to action.<br />
        <br />
        Learn more: <a href="/doc/marketing/widget">Store Widget</a><br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Localization</h3>
        While you are working on your game, it's useful to think about how the game will translate
        for players around the world. Localization impacts your game in a number of ways:<br />
        <br />
        Most Steam players don't speak English. Translating your game content (even if just UI and
        subtitles) into other languages will greatly expand the potential size of market for your
        game.<br />
        <br />
        Steam will prioritize recommending your game to players that speak the languages supported
        by your game. So, if you don't support Chinese, your game will show up less to players that
        only speak Chinese.<br />
        <br />
        Not all languages are equal. In general, we find that players in Asian countries are more
        impacted by lack of translation, whereas many Western European customers already speak
        English as a second language.<br />
        <br />

        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Alpha and Beta testing</h3>
        It can feel hard to share your game with others before you really feel that it's 'done' or
        polished enough. But gathering feedback is important to making sure you understand your
        audience and is great practice for communicating about your game. Through Steam you can run
        various kinds of testing with external groups of players. Here are a couple of options:<br />
        <ul>
            <li>
                Use Steam to deploy test builds across your internal team. Before your game is
                released, Steam can be used to give access to the game for your entire team,
                wherever they may be located.<br />
            </li>
            <li>
                Use beta test keys to grant your game to players you want to allow to play your
                game. You can revoke access to your game in the future if you wish. (note that when
                a player activates one of these keys, it will remove the game from recipients'
                wishlists, so be cautious when using)<br />
            </li>
            <li>
                Make use of <a href="/doc/features/playtest">Steam Playtest</a> to allow open access
                to a test build right from your store page. This is done through a secondary appID,
                which has the benefit of allowing you to run that beta alongside your release
                candidate app.
            </li>

    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Curator Connect</h3>
        When you are nearing release and want to get a copy of your game in the hands of reviewers,
        press, influencers, streamers, or other individuals that can help bring awareness of your
        game and amplify your efforts, you can do so directly in Steam. Many of the popular
        streamers, journalists, and community gaming sites are set up as Curators in Steam, and you
        can use Curator Connect to send them a copy of your game without having to email out
        keys.<br />
        <br />
        These influencers can post their reviews on Steam or wherever else they already post reviews
        or stream your game.<br />

        <h3>Review copies via Steam Keys</h3>
        If you don't find the influencer or journalist that you want on Curator Connect, you can
        always send them a review copy of your game with a Steam key.<br />

    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Live-stream (on Steam and elsewhere)</h3>
        During development and even on release day, you may want to live-stream your game (either
        yourself, someone on your team, or someone from the community that can show off your game in
        it's best light). You can host a live stream directly on your store page, which can be great
        for demonstrating exactly what it's like to play your game.<br />

        <h3>Upcoming releases page / queue (automatic)</h3>
        When your game has been posted as 'coming soon', it appears on the 'all upcoming releases'
        list, ordered by release date. Additionally, it can appear on other upcoming lists and pages
        as Steam, based on customer interest in your game, and can be recommended to players based
        on the tags applied to your game.<br />

        <h3>Your developer and publisher homepages (automatic)</h3>
        If you have created a homepage for the developer and/or publisher of the game, and linked
        this game with that page, Steam will automatically list your upcoming title on your homepage
        so players can see all the titles made by you or your publisher.<br />

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="3"></a>Release Day Marketing</h2>
When you get to release day, Steam has a number of tools that you can make use of to get the most
out of your launch. There are also a number of automatic ways that your game will show up within the
store, and also a number of ways it can appear across the platform.<br />
<br />
<ul>
    <li>
        <h3>Live-stream (on Steam and elsewhere)</h3>
        During the time surrounding the launch of your release, you may want to live-stream your
        game (either yourself, someone on your team, or someone from the community that can show off
        your game in it's best light). You can host a live stream directly on your store page, which
        can be great for demonstrating exactly what it's like to play your game, and give you an
        opportunity to chat directly with interested players that may have questions about your
        game.<br />

        <h3>Launch discount</h3>
        Discounting your game for the first week of sales is optional, and is a decision that should
        be made as part of your overall marketing and communication plan.<br />

        If you have created a homepage for the developer and/or publisher of the game, and linked

        to follow the dev or publisher.<br />

        <h3>New releases page / queue (automatic)</h3>
        When your game has newly released, it appears on the 'all new releases' list. Additionally,
        it can appear on other lists and pages as Steam notices the games' relative popularity.
        Mostly this is impacted by the number of players buying and playing your game, which should
        be a natural outcome of your various pre-release marketing efforts (see above for
        pre-release marketing tools and suggestions).<br />

        Once your game is available for sale, it can appear in many more places throughout Steam. It
        now qualifies to be recommended to players of similar games. These recommendations can show
        up at the top of the homepage of Steam, in a user's discovery queue, on individual tag or
        genre pages. The only thing you need to do is make sure you have appropriate tags applied to
        your game. <br />

    <li>
        <h3>Discounting</h3>
        Running regular discounts over the life of your game, and participating in seasonal events,
        is a great way to bring attention back to your game when you have a compelling offer for
        customers.<br />
        <br />
        When your game is on discount, it can show up in different places throughout the store and
        will trigger email notifications to players that have your game on their wishlist.<br />

        updates to address bugs reported by your fans, add new languages to expand your market,
        integrate new content, and keep expanding the value your game provides. Plus, each update is

        game is a great way to help players make the decision to buy and play your game. Running a
        live-stream right on your game's store page can be useful during a period of discounting or

        player shows up in the Steam community. Use this to add intrigue for your game or to

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="5"></a>Tools &amp; Resources outside of Steam</h2>
While Steam has many tools and systems to help with discovery and awareness of your game, there are
still a great many places outside of Steam that players rely on to learn about new games. You can
use these other channels to your advantage to make sure that potential customers are aware that your
game exists and is coming. As with any form of marketing, there is no specific recipe to follow. The
best results come from speaking to your audience in a way that is genuine for you and your
product.<br />
<br />
These are a few general suggestions, and are far from a comprehensive list of activities you can
utilize. We encourage you to look around at the wealth of information freely available online that
discusses various approaches to marketing. <br />
<ul>
    <li>
        <h3>Social media</h3>
        Try out some different approaches with social media and through different channels. You may
        find that some social sites are better suited for certain forms of interaction while others
        have different strengths.<br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Communities of players</h3>
        Identify where your audience hangs out and discusses relevant topics on the internet. Is
        there a community forum for players of games like yours? Are there community groups or chats
        that you can interact with? Are there streamers of games like yours that you can send a copy
        of your game to?<br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Learn from other devs</h3>
        There are a lot of articles out there by developers describing marketing activities they
        have done for their own games to reach players and build awareness and familiarity with
        their game. Seek these writings out and glean the useful information that applies to your
        situation and product. You might even try reaching out to developers that have done
        interesting things to pick their brains for more details or advice.<br />
        <br />
        Some suggested resources:<br />
        - Gamediscover .co<br />
        - Gamesindustry .biz <br />
        - r/gamedev<br />
        - etc.<br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Consumer game festivals (eg. PAX)</h3>
        Some developers find it valuable to build awareness by presenting their game at a booth at
        consumer shows. There are shows all over the world, so you can probably find one near you to
        start with and see what works for you. Some suggestions if you do take this approach:<br />

        Talk with other devs that have done this. Learn what you can from what they've tried and
        found valuable to do at shows.<br />
        Bring cards or something that interested players can take with them to remember your game
        and add it to their wishlist when they get back to their PC.<br />

        <h3>Advertising</h3>
        Some game developers find it valuable to buy advertisements to build an audience and drive
        traffic. You may want to consider this once your game is available to purchase.
