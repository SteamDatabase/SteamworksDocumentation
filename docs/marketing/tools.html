<h1>Features And Tools, Marketing</h1>
Steam works a bit differently than other stores in that we don't organize our store around paid ads.
In fact, we don't sell marketing space at all. Instead, the store is personalized for each player
based on what they are playing. Any curated promotional visibility is the result of proven customer
interest.<br /><br />So, how does your game get shown to players in the Steam store? This document
talks about the tools and features you can use in Steam to build awareness and audience in the weeks
and months leading up to release, get the most out of your buzz and excitement on release day, and
how to keep players engaged long after release. For information on how automatic visibility works on
Steam, please read

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>New to Marketing? Need a refresher?</h2>
There are many entire books written on marketing and we're not going to try to go into that level of
detail here. In a nutshell, marketing is often thought of as a combination of Product (what is your
game?), Position (how is your game different from other offerings?), Price (What value does your
game offer for the price you are asking?), People (Who is your audience? Who would be interested in
your game?), and Promotion (What compelling offer or awareness can you make to reach different
portions of your audience?). <br /><br />Check out our
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/marketing/bestpractices" class="bb_doclink"
    >Marketing 101 guide</a
>
for some useful definitions and tools to help you think about what your game is, who its for, and
how it fits in among other games and entertainment being offered today. Much of this advice comes
from talks we've given at Steam Dev Days. Check out all the

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="2"></a>Pre-release Marketing</h2>
Lets assume you have the basics figured out. You know what game you are building, how it fits among
other games, and who it is for. (if not, check out our
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/marketing/bestpractices" class="bb_doclink"
    >Marketing 101 guide</a
>
for a refresher and some suggestions). Here are some tools and resources that you might want to
consider for helping you along your way.<br /><br />
<ul class="bb_ul ">
    <li>
        <h3>Your Store Page</h3>
        One of the most powerful things you can do is create a home for your product where
        interested players have an action they can take. By setting up your Steam store page early,
        you'll have a place where fans can learn about your game, add it to their wishlist, and will
        automatically get notified when you get to release day. Use your store page to tell the
        story of your game and get to the point as quickly as possible. <br /><br />Learn more:

        ><br /><br /><br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Wishlists &amp; Notifications</h3>
        When players add your game to their wishlist, they will automatically get an e-mail when you
        hit the 'release' button and in the future when you run a discount on your game. For this
        reason alone, it's really useful to put up your 'coming soon' store page as soon as you are
        far along enough with your game to be able show off screenshots and describe the core of
        your game.<br /><br />Learn more:

            >Wishlist</a
        ><br /><br /><br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Tag your game</h3>
        Once you've got your store page set up, be sure to visit the page and add any additional
        relevant tags. Just click the "+" symbol next to the set of tags already applied (from the
        set of genres you picked during setup) and you'll see an interface that allows you to choose
        and enter other tags. Look around at other games like yours and see what tags are in use
        that are also relevant to your game–they might be thematic, gameplay, art style, or
        sub-genres. These tags help our recommendation engine and also provide information to
        players about what your game is like.<br /><br />Note that you as the developer can also
        remove tags if players have tagged your game with something incorrect. Just click the little
        flag next to the tag in the tagging interface.<br /><br />Learn more:

    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Announcements</h3>
        During development, leading up to release, and throughout the life of your game, you'll find
        the Steam announcements system to be a useful channel for keeping your players informed and
        gathering feedback. Use it to post development progress, share new artwork creations, or
        describe interesting features you are working on. <br /><br />Learn more:

    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Store Widget</h3>
        If you have your own website for your game and want to provide a handy link and synopsis of
        your game, you can use the store widget. This creates a little preview that you can embed on
        other websites and includes the price, artwork, and call to action.<br /><br />Learn more:

    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Localization</h3>
        While you are working on your game, it's useful to think about how the game will translate
        for players around the world. Localization impacts your game in a number of ways:<br /><br />Most
        Steam players don't speak English. Translating your game content (even if just UI and
        subtitles) into other languages will greatly expand the potential size of market for your
        game.<br /><br />Steam will prioritize recommending your game to players that speak the
        languages supported by your game. So, if you don't support Chinese, your game will show up
        less to players that only speak Chinese.<br /><br />Not all languages are equal. In general,
        we find that players in Asian countries are more impacted by lack of translation, whereas
        many Western European customers already speak English as a second language.<br /><br />Learn

        <h3>Alpha and Beta testing</h3>
        It can feel hard to share your game with others before you really feel that it's 'done' or
        polished enough. But gathering feedback is important to making sure you understand your
        audience and is great practice for communicating about your game. Through Steam you can run
        various kinds of testing with external groups of players. Here are a couple of options:<br /><br />Use
        Steam to deploy test builds across your internal team. Before your game is released, Steam
        can be used to give access to the game for your entire team, wherever they may be
        located.<br /><br />Use beta test keys to grant your game to players you want to allow to
        play your game. You can revoke access to your game in the future if you wish.<br /><br />Use
        the special Beta package to allow open access to a beta right from your store page. This is
        done through a secondary appID, which has the benefit of allowing you to run that beta
        alongside your release candidate app.<br /><br />Learn more:

    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Curator Connect</h3>
        When you are nearing release and want to get a copy of your game in the hands of reviewers,
        press, influencers, streamers, or other individuals that can help bring awareness of your
        game and amplify your efforts, you can do so directly in Steam. Many of the popular
        streamers, journalists, and community gaming sites are set up as Curators in Steam, and you
        can use Curator Connect to send them a copy of your game without having to email out
        keys.<br /><br />These influencers can post their reviews on Steam or wherever else they
        already post reviews or stream your game.<br /><br />Learn more:

        <h3>Review copies via Steam Keys</h3>

        always send them a review copy of your game with a Steam key.<br /><br />Learn more:

        <h3>Live-stream (on Steam and elsewhere)</h3>
        During development and even on release day, you may want to live-stream your game (either
        yourself, someone on your team, or someone from the community that can show off your game in
        it's best light). You can host a live stream directly on your store page, which can be great
        for demonstrating exactly what it's like to play your game.<br /><br />Learn more:

    <li>
        <h3>Upcoming releases page / queue (automatic)</h3>
        When your game has been posted as 'coming soon', it appears on the 'all upcoming releases'
        list, ordered by release date. Additionally, it can appear on other upcoming lists and pages
        as Steam, based on customer interest in your game, and can be recommended to players based
        on the tags applied to your game.<br /><br />Learn more:

        <h3>Your developer and publisher homepages (automatic)</h3>
        If you have created a homepage for the developer and/or publisher of the game, and linked
        this game with that page, Steam will automatically list your upcoming title on your homepage
        so players can see all the titles made by you or your publisher.<br /><br />Learn more:

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="3"></a>Release Day Marketing</h2>
When you get to release day, Steam has a number of tools that you can make use of to get the most
out of your launch. There are also a number of automatic ways that your game will show up within the
store, and also a number of ways it can appear across the platform.<br /><br />
<ul class="bb_ul ">
    <li>
        <h3>Live-stream (on Steam and elsewhere)</h3>
        During the time surrounding the launch of your release, you may want to live-stream your
        game (either yourself, someone on your team, or someone from the community that can show off
        your game in it's best light). You can host a live stream directly on your store page, which
        can be great for demonstrating exactly what it's like to play your game, and give you an
        opportunity to chat directly with interested players that may have questions about your
        game.<br /><br />Learn more:

        <h3>Launch discount</h3>
        Discounting your game for the first week of sales is optional, and is a decision that should
        be made as part of your overall marketing and communication plan.<br /><br />Learn more:

        <h3>New releases page / queue (automatic)</h3>
        When your game has newly released, it appears on the 'all new releases' list. Additionally,
        it can appear on other lists and pages as Steam notices the games' relative popularity.
        Mostly this is impacted by the number of players buying and playing your game, which should
        be a natural outcome of your various pre-release marketing efforts (see above for
        pre-release marketing tools and suggestions).<br /><br />Learn more:

        <h3>Recommendations (automatic)</h3>
        Once your game is available for sale, it can appear in many more places throughout Steam. It
        now qualifies to be recommended to players of similar games. These recommendations can show
        up at the top of the homepage of Steam, in a user's discovery queue, on individual tag or
        genre pages. The only thing you need to do is make sure you have appropriate tags applied to
        your game. <br /><br />Learn more:

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="4"></a>Marketing After Release</h2>
Throughout the life of your game, there are opportunities to bring greater visibility to your game
and to re-engage your fan base.<br /><br />
<ul class="bb_ul ">
    <li>
        <h3>Discounting</h3>
        Running regular discounts over the life of your game, and participating in seasonal events,
        is a great way to bring attention back to your game when you have a compelling offer for
        customers.<br /><br />When your game is on discount, it can show up in different places
        throughout the store and will trigger email notifications to players that have your game on
        their wishlist.<br /><br />Learn more:

        <h3>Update your game</h3>
        Update as frequently as you like and Steam will keep your players up to date. You can use
        updates to address bugs reported by your fans, add new languages to expand your market,
        integrate new content, and keep expanding the value your game provides. Plus, each update is
        a reason to remind players about why your game is great and why now is the perfect time to
        buy the game and start playing.<br /><br />Learn more:

        specific feature for getting word out about the biggest updates you have planned. When you
        post one of your biggest updates, you can trigger a special visibility option that shows

        You can use Steam Announcements to share news and events with your player base and
        prospective players visiting your store page. Each announcement shows up in the activity
        feed of players that follow your game. It also appears in your game's community hub and on
        your game's store page.<br /><br />Learn more:

        game is a great way to help players make the decision to buy and play your game. Running a
        live-stream right on your game's store page can be useful during a period of discounting or
        during another special event.<br /><br />Learn more:

        "Battling mega boss") to friends of the player via the Steam friends list and anywhere that
        player shows up in the Steam community. Use this to add intrigue for your game or to

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="5"></a>Tools &amp; Resources outside of Steam</h2>
While Steam has many tools and systems to help with discovery and awareness of your game, there are
still a great many places outside of Steam that players rely on to learn about new games. You can
use these other channels to your advantage to make sure that potential customers are aware that your
game exists and is coming. As with any form of marketing, there is no specific recipe to follow. The
best results come from speaking to your audience in a way that is genuine for you and your
product.<br /><br />These are a few general suggestions, and are far from a comprehensive list of
activities you can utilize. We encourage you to look around at the wealth of information freely
available online that discusses various approaches to marketing. <br />
<ul class="bb_ul ">
    <li>
        <h3>Social media</h3>
        Try out some different approaches with social media and through different channels. You may
        find that some social sites are better suited for certain forms of interaction while others
        have different strengths.<br /><br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Communities of players</h3>
        Identify where your audience hangs out and discusses relevant topics on the internet. Is
        there a community forum for players of games like yours? Are there community groups or chats
        that you can interact with? Are there streamers of games like yours that you can send a copy
        of your game to?<br /><br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Learn from other devs</h3>
        There are a lot of articles out there by developers describing marketing activities they
        have done for their own games to reach players and build awareness and familiarity with
        their game. Seek these writings out and glean the useful information that applies to your
        situation and product. You might even try reaching out to developers that have done
        interesting things to pick their brains for more details or advice.<br /><br />Some
        suggested resources:<br />- Gamasutra<br />- Gameindustry .biz<br />- r/gamedev<br />-
        etc.<br /><br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Consumer game festivals (eg. PAX)</h3>
        Some developers find it valuable to build awareness by presenting their game at a booth at
        consumer shows. There are shows all over the world, so you can probably find one near you to
        start with and see what works for you. Some suggestions if you do take this approach:<br /><br />Talk
        with other devs that have done this. Learn what you can from what they've tried and found
        valuable to do at shows.<br />Bring cards or something that interested players can take with
        them to remember your game and add it to their wishlist when they get back to their PC.<br /><br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Advertising</h3>
        Some game developers find it valuable to buy advertisements to build an audience and drive
        traffic. You may want to consider this once your game is available to purchase.
    </li>
</ul>
