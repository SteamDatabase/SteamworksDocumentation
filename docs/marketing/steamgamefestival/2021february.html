</ul>
<br /><strong>A Note on Future Events</strong><br /><br />Based on feedback from players and
developers, we have decided to make the Steam Game Festival a recurring event. The next event will
be the June 2021 Edition. In order to make the selection of games as relevant as possible for
customers, games must meet the following criteria to be eligible:<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        Games may only participate in one of the following events:
        <ul class="bb_ul">
            <li>Autumn 2020 (Oct, 2020)<br /></li>
            <li>February 2021<br /></li>
            <li>June 2021</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Participating games must have a planned release date within 6 months following the festival.
        If you think your release date will be more than 6 months after the festival, you should
        plan to opt-in to a future event. Note that releasing into Early Access will still count as
        a release, since the game will be purchasable and playable by the Steam community.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="6"></a>Events</h2>
During the festival, we encourage you to schedule streaming or other events to interact with the
Steam community and show off your demo. During the Steam Game Festival, you'll be able to schedule
up to two live stream events which will appear on a calendar for players to browse. <br /><br />For
