<br />
Initializes the ISteamGameServer interface object, and set server properties which may not be
changed.<br />
<br />
After calling this function, you should set any additional server parameters, and then call
<a href="/doc/api/ISteamGameServer#LogOnAnonymous">ISteamGameServer::LogOnAnonymous</a> or
<a href="/doc/api/ISteamGameServer#LogOn">ISteamGameServer::LogOn</a>.<br />
<br />
If you pass in
<a href="/doc/api/ISteamGameServer#MASTERSERVERUPDATERPORT_USEGAMESOCKETSHARE"
    >MASTERSERVERUPDATERPORT_USEGAMESOCKETSHARE</a
>
into <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">usQueryPort</code>, then the game server will
use GameSocketShare mode, which means that the game is responsible for sending and receiving UDP
packets for the master server updater.<br />
<br />
<strong>Returns:</strong> bool<br />

</h2>
<div class="bb_code cpp">inline void SteamGameServer_ReleaseCurrentThreadMemory();</div>
Frees the internal Steamworks API memory associated with the calling thread.<br />
<br />
Most Steamworks API functions allocate a small amount of thread-local memory for parameter storage,
calling this will manually free such memory. This function is called automatically by
<a href="#SteamGameServer_RunCallbacks">SteamGameServer_RunCallbacks</a>, so a program that only
ever accesses the Steamworks API from a single thread never needs to explicitly call this
function.<br />

<h2 class="bb_subsection">
    <a name="SteamGameServer_RunCallbacks"></a>SteamGameServer_RunCallbacks
</h2>
<div class="bb_code cpp">S_API void SteamGameServer_RunCallbacks();</div>
Dispatches callbacks created with STEAM_GAMESERVER_CALLBACK and call results to all of the
registered listeners.<br />
<br />
It's best to call this at &gt;10Hz, the more time between calls, the more potential latency between
receiving events or results from the Steamworks API.<br />
Most games call this once per render-frame. All registered listener functions will be invoked during
this call, in the callers thread context.<br />
<br />
SteamGameServer_RunCallbacks is safe to call from multiple threads simultaneously, but if you choose
to do this, callback code could be executed on any thread. One alternative is to call
SteamGameServer_RunCallbacks from the main thread only, and call
<a href="#SteamGameServer_ReleaseCurrentThreadMemory">SteamGameServer_ReleaseCurrentThreadMemory</a>
regularly on other threads.<br />
