<h1>ISteamNetworkingSockets Interface</h1>
Networking API similar to Berkeley sockets, but for games.<br />
<br />
<ul>
    <li>
        It's a connection-oriented API (like TCP, not UDP). When sending and receiving messages, the
        peer is identified using a connection handle.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        But unlike TCP, it's message-oriented, not stream-oriented. (The boundaries between the
        messages are maintained by the API.)<br />
    </li>
    <li>Both reliable and unreliable messages are supported.<br /></li>
    <li>
        Large messages are split into multiple packets, small messages are combined into fewer
        packets.<br />
    </li>
    <li>A robust ACK / reassembly / retransmission strategy.<br /></li>
    <li>
        Strong encryption and authentication. When a player connects, you can be sure that if a
        certain SteamID is authenticated, that someone who has access to that person's account has
        authorized the connection. Eavesdropping / tampering requires hacking into the VAC-secured
        process. Impersonation requires access to the target's computer.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Supports relayed connections through the Valve network. This prevents IP addresses from
        being revealed, protecting your players and gameservers from attack.<br />
    </li>
    <li>Also supports standard connectivity over plain UDP using IPv4 or IPv6.</li>
</ul>

        <a href="/doc/api/ISteamNetworkingMessages">ISteamNetworkingMessages</a> is a UDP-style
        interface. Send and receive messages by specifying the destination peer in each send call,
        instead of establishing a connection first. The same connections are still used under the
        hood, so you still get the same performance, but the connections are created and idle timed
        out for you automatically, and you do not receive quite as much control over the connection,
        or feedback about its state.
    </li>
</ul>

An opensource version of this API is available on
<a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/GameNetworkingSockets" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
    >github</a
>. You can use it for whatever purpose you want. To use the Valve network you need to be a Steam
partner and use the version in the Steamworks SDK.<br />
<br />
Member functions for ISteamNetworkingSockets are called through the global accessor function
SteamNetworkingSockets().

<div class="bb_code cpp">
    HSteamListenSocket CreateListenSocketIP( const SteamNetworkingIPAddr &amp;localAddress, int
    nOptions, const SteamNetworkingConfigValue_t *pOptions );
</div>
<br />
Creates a "server" socket that listens for clients to connect to by calling
<a href="/doc/api/ISteamNetworkingSockets#ConnectByIPAddress"
    >ISteamNetworkingSockets::ConnectByIPAddress</a
>, over ordinary UDP (IPv4 or IPv6)<br />
<br />
You must select a specific local port to listen on and set it as the port field of the local
address.<br />
<br />
Usually you will set the IP portion of the address to zero, (<a
    href="/doc/api/steamnetworkingtypes#SteamNetworkingIPAddr"
    >SteamNetworkingIPAddr</a
>::Clear()). This means that you will not bind to any particular local interface (i.e. the same as
INADDR_ANY in plain socket code). Furthermore, if possible the socket will be bound in "dual stack"
mode, which means that it can accept both IPv4 and IPv6 client connections. If you really do wish to
bind a particular interface, then set the local address to the appropriate IPv4 or IPv6 IP.<br />
<br />
If you need to set any initial config options, pass them here. See
<a href="/doc/api/steamnetworkingtypes#SteamNetworkingConfigValue_t"
    >SteamNetworkingConfigValue_t</a
>
for more about why this is preferable to setting the options "immediately" after creation.<br />
<br />
When a client attempts to connect, a
<a href="/doc/api/ISteamNetworkingSockets#SteamNetConnectionStatusChangedCallback_t"
    >SteamNetConnectionStatusChangedCallback_t</a
>
will be posted. The connection will be in the k_ESteamNetworkingConnectionState_Connecting state.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="ConnectByIPAddress"></a>ConnectByIPAddress</h2>
<div class="bb_code cpp">
    HSteamNetConnection ConnectByIPAddress( const SteamNetworkingIPAddr &amp;address, int nOptions,
    const SteamNetworkingConfigValue_t *pOptions );
</div>
<br />
Creates a connection and begins talking to a "server" over UDP at the given IPv4 or IPv6 address.
The remote host must be listening with a matching call to
<a href="/doc/api/ISteamnetworkingSockets#CreateListenSocketIP"
    >ISteamnetworkingSockets::CreateListenSocketIP</a
>
on the specified port.<br />
<br />
A
<a href="/doc/api/ISteamNetworkingSockets#SteamNetConnectionStatusChangedCallback_t"
    >SteamNetConnectionStatusChangedCallback_t</a
>
callback will be triggered when we start connecting, and then another one on either timeout or
successful connection.<br />
<br />
If the server does not have any identity configured, then their network address will be the only
identity in use. Or, the network host may provide a platform-specific identity with or without a
valid certificate to authenticate that identity. (These details will be contained in the
<a href="/doc/api/ISteamNetworkingSockets#SteamNetConnectionStatusChangedCallback_t"
    >SteamNetConnectionStatusChangedCallback_t</a
>.) It's up to your application to decide whether to allow the connection.<br />
<br />
If you need to set any initial config options, pass them here. See

    >SteamNetworkingConfigValue_t</a

for more about why this is preferable to setting the options "immediately" after creation.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="CreateListenSocketP2P"></a>CreateListenSocketP2P</h2>
<div class="bb_code cpp">
    HSteamListenSocket CreateListenSocketP2P( int nLocalVirtualPort, int nOptions, const
    SteamNetworkingConfigValue_t *pOptions );
</div>
<br />
Like
<a href="/doc/api/ISteamNetworkingSockets#CreateListenSocketIP"
    >ISteamNetworkingSockets::CreateListenSocketIP</a
>, but clients will connect using
<a href="/doc/api/ISteamNetworkingSockets#ConnectP2P">ISteamNetworkingSockets::ConnectP2P</a>. The
connection will be relayed through the Valve network.<br />
<br />
nLocalVirtualPort specifies how clients can connect to this socket using
<a href="/doc/api/ConnectP2P">ConnectP2P</a>. It's very common for applications to only have one
listening socket; in that case, use zero. If you need to open multiple listen sockets and have
clients be able to connect to one or the other, then nLocalVirtualPort should be a small integer
(&lt;1000) unique to each listen socket you create.<br />
<br />
If you are listening on a dedicated servers in known data center, then you can listen using this
function instead of
<a href="/doc/api/CreateHostedDedicatedServerListenSocket"
    >CreateHostedDedicatedServerListenSocket</a
>, to allow clients to connect without a ticket. Any user that owns the app and is signed into Steam
will be able to attempt to connect to your server. Also, a connection attempt may require the client
to be connected to Steam, which is one more moving part that may fail. When tickets are used, then
once a ticket is obtained, a client can connect to your server even if they got disconnected from
Steam or Steam is offline.<br />
<br />
If you use this, you probably want to call
<a href="/doc/api/ISteamNetworkingUtils#InitRelayNetworkAccess"
    >ISteamNetworkingUtils::InitRelayNetworkAccess</a
>
when your app initializes.<br />
<br />
If you need to set any initial config options, pass them here. See
<a href="/doc/api/steamnetworkingtypes#SteamNetworkingConfigValue_t"
    >SteamNetworkingConfigValue_t</a
>
for more about why this is preferable to setting the options "immediately" after creation.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="ConnectP2P"></a>ConnectP2P</h2>
<div class="bb_code cpp">
    HSteamNetConnection ConnectP2P( const SteamNetworkingIdentity &amp;identityRemote, int
    nRemoteVirtualPort, int nOptions, const SteamNetworkingConfigValue_t *pOptions );
</div>
Begin connecting to a peer that is identified using a platform-specific identifier. This uses the
default rendezvous service, which depends on the platform and library configuration. (E.g. on Steam,
it goes through the steam backend.) The traffic is relayed over the Steam Datagram Relay network.<br />
<br />
If you use this, you probably want to call
<a href="/doc/api/ISteamNetworkingUtils#InitRelayNetworkAccess"
    >ISteamNetworkingUtils::InitRelayNetworkAccess</a

<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="AcceptConnection"></a>AcceptConnection</h2>
<div class="bb_code cpp">EResult AcceptConnection( HSteamNetConnection hConn );</div>
<br />
Accept an incoming connection that has been received on a listen socket.<br />
<br />
When a connection attempt is received (perhaps after a few basic handshake packets have been
exchanged to prevent trivial spoofing), a connection interface object is created in the
k_ESteamNetworkingConnectionState_Connecting state and a
<a href="/doc/api/ISteamNetworkingSockets#SteamNetConnectionStatusChangedCallback_t"
    >SteamNetConnectionStatusChangedCallback_t</a
>
is posted. At this point, your application MUST either accept or close the connection. (It may not
ignore it.) Accepting the connection will transition it either into the connected state, or the
finding route state, depending on the connection type.<br />
<br />
You should take action within a second or two, because accepting the connection is what actually
sends the reply notifying the client that they are connected. If you delay taking action, from the
client's perspective it is the same as the network being unresponsive, and the client may timeout
the connection attempt. In other words, the client cannot distinguish between a delay caused by
network problems and a delay caused by the application.<br />
<br />
This means that if your application goes for more than a few seconds without processing callbacks
(for example, while loading a map), then there is a chance that a client may attempt to connect in
that interval and fail due to timeout.<br />
<br />
If the application does not respond to the connection attempt in a timely manner, and we stop
receiving communication from the client, the connection attempt will<br />
be timed out locally, transitioning the connection to the
k_ESteamNetworkingConnectionState_ProblemDetectedLocally state. The client may also close the
connection before it is accepted, and a transition to the
k_ESteamNetworkingConnectionState_ClosedByPeer is also possible depending the exact sequence of
events.<br />
<br />
Returns:<br />
<ul>
    <li>k_EResultInvalidParam if the handle is invalid.<br /></li>
    <li>
        k_EResultInvalidState if the connection is not in the appropriate state. (Remember that the
        connection state could change in between the time that the notification being posted to the
        queue and when it is received by the application.)
    </li>
</ul>
<br />
A note about connection configuration options. If you need to set any configuration options that are
common to all connections accepted through a particular listen socket, consider setting the options
on the listen socket, since such options are inherited automatically. If you really do need to set
options that are connection specific, it is safe to set them on the connection before accepting the
connection.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="CloseConnection"></a>CloseConnection</h2>
<div class="bb_code cpp">
    bool CloseConnection( HSteamNetConnection hPeer, int nReason, const char *pszDebug, bool
    bEnableLinger );
</div>
<br />
Disconnects from the remote host and invalidates the connection handle. Any unread data on the
connection is discarded.<br />
<br />
nReason is an application defined code that will be received on the other end and recorded (when
possible) in backend analytics. The value should come from a restricted range. (See
<a href="/doc/api/steamnetworkingtypes#ESteamNetConnectionEnd">ESteamNetConnectionEnd</a>.) If you
don't need to communicate any information to the remote host, and do not want analytics to be able
to distinguish "normal" connection terminations from "exceptional" ones, you may pass zero, in which
case the generic value of k_ESteamNetConnectionEnd_App_Generic will be used.<br />
<br />
pszDebug is an optional human-readable diagnostic string that will be received by the remote host
and recorded (when possible) in backend analytics.<br />
<br />
Optionally, you may put the socket into a "linger" state, which causes the connection to attempt is
deliver any remaining outbound reliable messages before actually closing the connection. Otherwise
any unsent reliable data is discarded. In any case, once you close the connection you will have no
further visibility into the status of the connection or any messages. (In some uses cases, this is
acceptable. If not, then you need to wait to close the connection.) Remember that this is an
application protocol, not a kernel protocol like TCP. So you need to make sure the application stays
running long enough for the data to be flushed out.<br />
<br />
If the connection has already ended (k_ESteamNetworkingConnectionState_ClosedByPeer or
k_ESteamNetworkingConnectionState_ProblemDetectedLocally) and you are just freeing up the connection
object, then nReason, pszDebug , and bEnableLinger are ignored.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="CloseListenSocket"></a>CloseListenSocket</h2>
<div class="bb_code cpp">bool CloseListenSocket( HSteamListenSocket hSocket );</div>
<br />
Destroy a listen socket. All the connections that were accepted on the listen socket are closed
ungracefully.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="CreateSocketPair"></a>CreateSocketPair</h2>
<div class="bb_code cpp">
    bool CreateSocketPair( HSteamNetConnection *pOutConnection1, HSteamNetConnection
    *pOutConnection2, bool bUseNetworkLoopback, const SteamNetworkingIdentity *pIdentity1, const
    SteamNetworkingIdentity *pIdentity2 );
</div>
<br />
Create a pair of connections that are talking to each other, e.g. a loopback connection. This is
very useful for testing, or so that your client/server code can work the same even when you are
running a local "server".<br />
<br />
The two connections will immediately be placed into the connected state, and no callbacks will be
posted immediately. After this, if you close either connection, the other connection will receive a
callback, exactly as if they were communicating over the network. You must close *both* sides in
order to fully clean up the resources!<br />
<br />
By default, internal buffers are used, completely bypassing the network, the chopping up of messages
into packets, encryption, copying the payload, etc. This means that loopback packets, by default,
will not simulate lag or loss. Passing true for bUseNetworkLoopback will cause the socket pair to
send packets through the local network loopback device (127.0.0.1) on ephemeral ports. Fake lag and
loss are supported in this case, and CPU time is expended to encrypt and decrypt.<br />
<br />
If you wish to assign a specific identity to either connection, you may pass a particular identity.
Otherwise, if you pass nullptr, the respective connection will assume a generic "localhost"
identity. If you use real network loopback, this might be translated to the actual bound loopback
port. Otherwise, the port will be zero.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="functions_send_recv"></a>Sending and receiving messages</h2>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="SendMessageToConnection"></a>SendMessageToConnection</h2>
<div class="bb_code cpp">
    EResult SendMessageToConnection( HSteamNetConnection hConn, const void *pData, uint32 cbData,
    int nSendFlags, int64 *pOutMessageNumber );
</div>
Send a message to the remote host on the specified connection.<br />
<br />
nSendFlags determines the delivery guarantees that will be provided, when data should be buffered,
etc. E.g.:<br />
<ul>
    <li>k_nSteamNetworkingSend_Unreliable<br /></li>
    <li>k_nSteamNetworkingSend_Reliable<br /></li>
    <li>k_nSteamNetworkingSend_NoNagle<br /></li>
    <li>k_nSteamNetworkingSend_NoDelay</li>
</ul>
<br />
Note that the semantics we use for messages are not precisely the same as the semantics of a
standard "stream" socket. (SOCK_STREAM) For an ordinary stream socket, the boundaries between chunks
are not considered relevant, and the sizes of the chunks of data written will not necessarily match
up to the sizes of the chunks that are returned by the reads on the other end. The remote host might
read a partial chunk, or chunks might be coalesced. For the message semantics used here, however,
the sizes WILL match. Each send call will match a successful read call on the remote host
one-for-one. If you are porting existing stream-oriented code to the semantics of reliable messages,
your code should work the same, since reliable message semantics are more strict than stream
semantics. The only caveat is related to performance: there is per-message overhead to retain the
message sizes, and so if your code sends many small chunks of data, performance will suffer. Any
code based on stream sockets that does not write excessively small chunks will work without any
changes. <br />
<br />
The pOutMessageNumber is an optional pointer to receive the message number assigned to the message,
if sending was successful.<br />
<br />
Returns:<br />
<ul>
    <li>
        k_EResultInvalidParam: invalid connection handle, or the individual message is too big. (See
        k_cbMaxSteamNetworkingSocketsMessageSizeSend)<br />
    </li>
    <li>k_EResultInvalidState: connection is in an invalid state<br /></li>
    <li>k_EResultNoConnection: connection has ended<br /></li>
    <li>
        k_EResultIgnored: You used k_nSteamNetworkingSend_NoDelay, and the message was dropped
        because we were not ready to send it.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        k_EResultLimitExceeded: there was already too much data queued to be sent. (See
        k_ESteamNetworkingConfig_SendBufferSize)
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="SendMessages"></a>SendMessages</h2>
<div class="bb_code cpp">
    void SendMessages( int nMessages, SteamNetworkingMessage_t *const *pMessages, int64
    *pOutMessageNumberOrResult );
</div>
Send one or more messages without copying the message payload. This is the most efficient way to
send messages. To use this function, you must first allocate a message object using
<a href="/doc/api/ISteamNetworkingUtils#AllocateMessage">ISteamNetworkingUtils::AllocateMessage</a>.
(Do not declare one on the stack or allocate your own.)<br />
<br />
You should fill in the message payload. You can either let it allocate the buffer for you and then
fill in the payload, or if you already have a buffer allocated, you can just point m_pData at your
buffer and set the callback to the appropriate function to free it. Note that if you use your own
buffer, it MUST remain valid until the callback is executed. And also note that your callback can be
invoked at any time from any thread (perhaps even before SendMessages returns!), so it MUST be fast
and threadsafe.<br />
<br />
You MUST also fill in:<br />
<ul>
    <li>m_conn - the handle of the connection to send the message to<br /></li>
    <li>m_nFlags - bitmask of k_nSteamNetworkingSend_xxx flags.</li>
</ul>
<br />
All other fields are currently reserved and should not be modified.<br />
<br />
The library will take ownership of the message structures. They may be modified or become invalid at
any time, so you must not read them after passing them to this function.<br />
<br />
pOutMessageNumberOrResult is an optional array that will receive, for each message, the message
number that was assigned to the message if sending was successful. If sending failed, then a
negative EResult value is placed into the array. For example, the array will hold
-k_EResultInvalidState if the connection was in an invalid state. See
<a href="/doc/api/ISteamNetworkingSockets#SendMessageToConnection"
    >ISteamNetworkingSockets::SendMessageToConnection</a
>
for possible failure codes.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="FlushMessagesOnConnection"></a>FlushMessagesOnConnection</h2>
<div class="bb_code cpp">EResult FlushMessagesOnConnection( HSteamNetConnection hConn );</div>
Flush any messages waiting on the Nagle timer and send them at the next transmission opportunity
(often that means right now).<br />
<br />
If Nagle is enabled (it's on by default) then when calling SendMessageToConnection the message will
be buffered, up to the Nagle time before being sent, to merge small messages into the same packet.
(See k_ESteamNetworkingConfig_NagleTime)<br />
<br />
Returns:<br />
<ul>
    <li>k_EResultInvalidParam: invalid connection handle<br /></li>
    <li>k_EResultInvalidState: connection is in an invalid state<br /></li>
    <li>k_EResultNoConnection: connection has ended<br /></li>
    <li>k_EResultIgnored: We weren't (yet) connected, so this operation has no effect.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="ReceiveMessagesOnConnection"></a>ReceiveMessagesOnConnection</h2>
<div class="bb_code cpp">
    int ReceiveMessagesOnConnection( HSteamNetConnection hConn, SteamNetworkingMessage_t
    **ppOutMessages, int nMaxMessages );
</div>
Fetch the next available message(s) from the connection, if any. Returns the number of messages
returned into your array, up to nMaxMessages.<br />
If the connection handle is invalid, -1 is returned. If no data is available, 0, is returned.<br />
<br />
The order of the messages returned in the array is relevant. Reliable messages will be received in
the order they were sent (and with the same sizes --- see SendMessageToConnection for on this subtle
difference from a stream socket).<br />
<br />
Unreliable messages may be dropped, or delivered out of order with respect to each other or with
respect to reliable messages.<br />
<br />
If any messages are returned, you MUST call
<a href="/doc/api/steamnetworkingtypes#SteamNetworkingMessage_t">SteamNetworkingMessage_t</a
>::Release() to each of them free up resources after you are done. It is safe to keep the object
alive for a little while (put it into some queue, etc), and you may call Release() from any thread.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="functions_poll_groups"></a>Polling many connections efficiently</h2>
<br />
A <i>poll group</i> is a set of connections that can be polled efficiently. (In this API, to "poll"
a connection means to retrieve all pending messages. We actually don't have an API to "poll" the
connection <i>state</i>, like BSD sockets.)
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="CreatePollGroup"></a>CreatePollGroup</h2>
<div class="bb_code cpp">HSteamNetPollGroup CreatePollGroup()</div>
Create a new poll group.<br />
<br />
You should destroy the poll group when you are done using
<a href="/doc/api/ISteamNetworkingSockets#DestroyPollGroup"
    >ISteamNetworkingSockets::DestroyPollGroup</a
>.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="DestroyPollGroup"></a>DestroyPollGroup</h2>
<div class="bb_code cpp">bool DestroyPollGroup( HSteamNetPollGroup hPollGroup )</div>
Destroy a poll group created with
<a href="/doc/api/ISteamNetworkingSockets#CreatePollGroup"
    >ISteamNetworkingSockets::CreatePollGroup</a
>.<br />
<br />
If there are any connections in the poll group, they are removed from the group, and left in a state
where they are not part of any poll group. Returns false if passed an invalid poll group handle.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="SetConnectionPollGroup"></a>SetConnectionPollGroup</h2>
<div class="bb_code cpp">
    bool SetConnectionPollGroup( HSteamNetConnection hConn, HSteamNetPollGroup hPollGroup );
</div>
<br />
Assign a connection to a poll group. Note that a connection may only belong to a single poll group.
Adding a connection to a poll group implicitly removes it from any other poll group it is in.<br />
<br />
You can pass k_HSteamNetPollGroup_Invalid to remove a connection from its current poll group without
adding it to a new poll group.<br />
<br />
If there are received messages currently pending on the connection, an attempt is made to add them
to the queue of messages for the poll group in approximately the order that would have applied if
the connection was already part of the poll group at the time that the messages were received.<br />
<br />
Returns false if the connection handle is invalid, or if the poll group handle is invalid (and not
k_HSteamNetPollGroup_Invalid).
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="ReceiveMessagesOnPollGroup"></a>ReceiveMessagesOnPollGroup</h2>
<div class="bb_code cpp">
    int ReceiveMessagesOnPollGroup( HSteamNetPollGroup hPollGroup, SteamNetworkingMessage_t
    **ppOutMessages, int nMaxMessages );
</div>
<br />
Same as
<a href="/doc/api/ISteamNetworkingSockets#ReceiveMessagesOnConnection"
    >ISteamNetworkingSockets::ReceiveMessagesOnConnection</a
>, but will return the next messages available on any connection in the poll group. Examine
<a href="/doc/api/steamnetworkingtypes#SteamNetworkingMessage_t">SteamNetworkingMessage_t</a
>::m_conn to know which connection. (<a
    href="/doc/api/steamnetworkingtypes#SteamNetworkingMessage_t"
    >SteamNetworkingMessage_t</a
>::m_nConnUserData might also be useful.)<br />
<br />
Delivery order of messages among different connections will usually match the order that the last
packet was received which completed the message. But this is not a strong guarantee, especially for
packets received right as a connection is being assigned to poll group.<br />
<br />
Delivery order of messages on the same connection is well defined and the same guarantees are
present as mentioned in
<a href="/doc/api/ISteamNetworkingSockets#ReceiveMessagesOnConnection"
    >ISteamNetworkingSockets::ReceiveMessagesOnConnection</a
>. (But the messages are not grouped by connection, so they will not necessarily appear
consecutively in the list; they may be interleaved with messages for other connections.)
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="functions_connection_info"></a>Connection info</h2>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="GetConnectionInfo"></a>GetConnectionInfo</h2>
<div class="bb_code cpp">
    bool GetConnectionInfo( HSteamNetConnection hConn, SteamNetConnectionInfo_t *pInfo );

Returns basic information about the high-level state of the connection.<br />
Returns false if the connection handle is invalid.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="GetConnectionRealTimeStatus"></a>GetConnectionRealTimeStatus</h2>
<div class="bb_code cpp">

<br />
Returns a small set of information about the real-time state of the connection and the queue status
of each lane.<br />
<br />
pStatus may be NULL if the information is not desired. (E.g. you are only interested in the lane
information.)<br />
<br />
On entry, nLanes specifies the length of the pLanes array. This may be 0 if you do not wish to
receive any lane data. It's OK for this to be smaller than the total number of configured lanes.<br />
<br />
pLanes points to an array that will receive lane-specific info. It can be NULL if this is not
needed.<br />
<br />
Return value:<br />

WARNING: Be *very careful* when using the value provided in callbacks structs. Callbacks are queued,
and the value that you will receive in your callback is the userdata that was effective at the time
the callback was queued. There are subtle race conditions that can happen if you<br />
don't understand this!<br />
<br />
If any incoming messages for this connection are queued, the userdata field is updated, so that when
when you receive messages (e.g. with ReceiveMessagesOnConnection), they will always have the very
latest userdata. So the tricky race conditions that can happen with callbacks do not apply to
retrieving messages.<br />

<div class="bb_code cpp">
    EResult ConfigureConnectionLanes( HSteamNetConnection hConn, int nNumLanes, const int
    *pLanePriorities, const uint16 *pLaneWeights );
</div>
<br />
Configure multiple outbound messages streams ("lanes") on a connection, and control head-of-line
blocking between them. Messages within a given lane are always sent in the order they are queued,
but messages from different lanes may be sent out of order. Each lane has its own message number
sequence. The first message sent on each lane will be assigned the number 1.<br />
<br />
Each lane has a "priority". Lower priority lanes will only be processed when all higher-priority
lanes are empty. The magnitudes of the priority values are not relevant, only their sort order.
Higher numeric values take priority over lower numeric values.<br />
<br />
Each lane also is assigned a weight, which controls the approximate proportion of the bandwidth that
will be consumed by the lane, relative to other lanes of the same priority. (This is assuming the
lane stays busy. An idle lane does not build up "credits" to be be spent once a message is queued.)
This value is only meaningful as a proportion, relative to other lanes with the same priority. For
lanes with different priorities, the strict priority order will prevail, and their weights relative
to each other are not relevant. Thus, if a lane has a unique priority value, the weight value for
that lane is not relevant. <br />
<br />
Example: 3 lanes, with priorities { 0, 10, 10 } and weights { (NA), 20, 5 }. Messages sent on the
first will always be sent first, before messages in the other two lanes. Its weight value is
irrelevant, since there are no other lanes with priority=0. The other two lanes will share
bandwidth, with the second and third lanes sharing bandwidth using a ratio of approximately 4:1.
(The weights { NA, 4, 1 } would be equivalent.)<br />
<br />
Notes:<br />
<ul>
    <li>
        At the time of this writing, some code has performance cost that is linear in the number of
        lanes, so keep the number of lanes to an absolute minimum. 3 or so is fine; &gt;8 is a lot.
        The max number of lanes on Steam is 255, which is a very large number and not
        recommended!<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Lane priority values may be any int. Their absolute value is not relevant, only the order
        matters.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Weights must be positive, and due to implementation details, they are restricted to 16-bit
        values. The absolute magnitudes don't matter, just the proportions.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Messages sent on a lane index other than 0 have a small overhead on the wire, so for maximum
        wire efficiency, lane 0 should be the "most common" lane, regardless of priorities or
        weights.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        A connection has a single lane by default. Calling this function with nNumLanes=1 is legal,
        but pointless, since the priority and weight values are irrelevant in that case.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        You may reconfigure connection lanes at any time, however reducing the number of lanes is
        not allowed.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Reconfiguring lanes might restart any bandwidth sharing balancing. Usually you will call
        this function once, near the start of the connection, perhaps after exchanging a few
        messages.<br />
    </li>
    <li>To assign all lanes the same priority, you may use pLanePriorities=NULL.<br /></li>
    <li>
        If you wish all lanes with the same priority to share bandwidth equally (or if no two lanes
        have the same priority value, and thus priority values are irrelevant), you may use
        pLaneWeights=NULL<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Priorities and weights determine the order that messages are SENT on the wire. There are NO
        GUARANTEES on the order that messages are RECEIVED! Due to packet loss, out-of-order
        delivery, and subtle details of packet serialization, messages might still be received
        slightly out-of-order! The *only* strong guarantee is that *reliable* messages on the *same
        lane* will be delivered in the order they are sent.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Each host configures the lanes for the packets they send; the lanes for the flow in one
        direction are completely unrelated to the lanes in the opposite direction.

Indicate our desire to be ready participate in authenticated communications. If we are currently not

for us, as well as any CA certificates needed to authenticate peers.)<br />
<br />
You can call this at program init time if you know that you are going to be making authenticated
connections, so that we will be ready immediately when those connections are attempted. (Note that
essentially all connections require authentication, with the exception of ordinary UDP connections
with authentication disabled using k_ESteamNetworkingConfig_IP_AllowWithoutAuth.) If you don't call
this function, we will wait until a feature is utilized that that necessitates these resources.<br />
<br />
You can also call this function to force a retry, if failure has occurred. Once we make an attempt
and fail, we will not automatically retry. In this respect, the behavior of the system after trying
and failing is the same as before the first attempt: attempting authenticated communication or
calling this function will call the system to attempt to acquire the necessary resources.<br />

Search cache for a ticket to talk to the server on the specified virtual port. If found, returns the
number of seconds until the ticket expires, and optionally the complete cracked ticket. Returns 0 if

Client call to connect to a server hosted in a Valve data center, on the specified virtual port. You
must have placed a ticket for this server into the cache, or else this connect attempt will fail! If
you are not issuing your own tickets, then to connect to a dedicated server via SDR in auto-ticket

type of connection by listening using
<a href="/doc/api/CreateListenSocketP2P">CreateListenSocketP2P</a>.)<br />
<br />
You may wonder why tickets are stored in a cache, instead of simply being passed as an argument
here. The reason is to make reconnection to a gameserver robust, even if the client computer loses
connection to Steam or the central backend, or the app is restarted or crashes, etc.<br />

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>FakeIP system</h2>
<br />
A "FakeIP" is essentially a temporary, arbitrary identifier that happens to be a valid IPv4 address.
The purpose of this system is to make it easy to integrate with existing code that identifies hosts
using IPv4 addresses. The FakeIP address will never actually be used to send or receive any packets
on the Internet, it is strictly an identifier.<br />
<br />
FakeIP addresses are designed to (hopefully) pass through existing code as transparently as
possible, while conflicting with "real" addresses that might be in use on networks (both the
Internet and LANs) in the same code as little as possible. At the time this comment is being
written, they come from the 169.254.0.0/16 range, and the port number will always be &gt;1024.
HOWEVER, this is subject to change! Do not make assumptions about these addresses, or your code
might break in the future. In particular, you should use functions such as
<a href="/doc/api/ISteamNetworkingUtils#IsFakeIP">ISteamNetworkingUtils::IsFakeIP</a> to determine
if an IP address is a "fake" one used by this system.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="BeginAsyncRequestFakeIP"></a>BeginAsyncRequestFakeIP</h2>
<div class="bb_code cpp">bool BeginAsyncRequestFakeIP( int nNumPorts );</div>
<br />
Begin asynchronous process of allocating a fake IPv4 address that other peers can use to contact us
via P2P. IP addresses returned by this function are globally unique for a given appid.<br />
<br />
nNumPorts is the numbers of ports you wish to reserve. This is useful for the same reason that
listening on multiple UDP ports is useful for different types of traffic. Because these allocations
come from a global namespace, there is a relatively strict limit on the maximum number of ports you
may request. (At the time of this writing, the limit is 4.) The port assignments are *not*
guaranteed to have any particular order or relationship! Do *not* assume they are contiguous, even
though that may often occur in practice.<br />
<br />
Returns false if a request was already in progress, true if a new request was started. A
SteamNetworkingFakeIPResult_t will be posted when the request completes.<br />
<br />
For gameservers, you *must* call this after initializing the SDK but before beginning login. Steam
needs to know in advance that FakeIP will be used. Everywhere your public IP would normally appear
(such as the server browser) will be replaced by the FakeIP, and the fake port at index 0. The
request is actually queued until the logon completes, so you must not wait until the allocation
completes before logging in. Except for trivial failures that can be detected locally (e.g. invalid
parameter), a SteamNetworkingFakeIPResult_t callback (whether success or failure) will not be posted
until after we have logged in. Furthermore, it is assumed that FakeIP allocation is essential for
your application to function, and so failure will not be reported until *several* retries have been
attempted. This process may last several minutes. It is *highly* recommended to treat failure as
fatal.<br />
<br />
To communicate using a connection-oriented (TCP-style) API:<br />
<ul>
    <li>Server creates a listen socket using CreateListenSocketP2PFakeIP<br /></li>
    <li>Client connects using ConnectByIPAddress, passing in the FakeIP address.<br /></li>
    <li>
        The connection will behave mostly like a P2P connection. The identities that appear in
        SteamNetConnectionInfo_t will be the FakeIP identity until we know the real identity. Then
        it will be the real identity. If the SteamNetConnectionInfo_t::m_addrRemote is valid, it
        will be a real IPv4 address of a NAT-punched connection. Otherwise, it will not be valid.

<br />
Create a listen socket that will listen for P2P connections sent to our FakeIP. A peer can initiate
connections to this listen socket by calling
<a href="/doc/api/ConnectByIPAddress">ConnectByIPAddress</a>.<br />
<br />
idxFakePort refers to the *index* of the fake port requested, not the actual port number. For
example, pass 0 to refer to the first port in the reservation. You must call this only after calling
<a href="/doc/api/BeginAsyncRequestFakeIP">BeginAsyncRequestFakeIP</a>. However, you do not need to
wait for the request to complete before creating the listen socket.

<div class="bb_code cpp">
    EResult GetRemoteFakeIPForConnection( HSteamNetConnection hConn, SteamNetworkingIPAddr *pOutAddr
    );
</div>
<br />
If the connection was initiated using the "FakeIP" system, then we we can get an IP address for the
remote host. If the remote host had a global FakeIP at the time the connection was established, this
function will return that global IP. Otherwise, a FakeIP that is unique locally will be allocated
from the local FakeIP address space, and that will be returned.<br />
<br />
The allocation of local FakeIPs attempts to assign addresses in a consistent manner. If multiple
connections are made to the same remote host, they *probably* will return the same FakeIP. However,
since the namespace is limited, this cannot be guaranteed.<br />
<br />
On failure, returns:<br />
<ul>
    <li>k_EResultInvalidParam: invalid connection handle<br /></li>
    <li>k_EResultIPNotFound: This connection wasn't made using FakeIP system</li>
</ul>

<div class="bb_code cpp">
    ISteamNetworkingFakeUDPPort *CreateFakeUDPPort( int idxFakeServerPort );
</div>
<br />
Get an interface that can be used like a UDP port to send/receive datagrams to a FakeIP address.
This is intended to make it easy to port existing UDP-based code to take advantage of SDR.<br />
<br />
idxFakeServerPort refers to the *index* of the port allocated using
<a href="/doc/api/BeginAsyncRequestFakeIP">BeginAsyncRequestFakeIP</a> and is used to create
"server" ports. You may call this before the allocation has completed. However, any attempts to send
packets will fail until the allocation has succeeded. When the peer receives packets sent from this
interface, the from address of the packet will be the globally-unique FakeIP. If you call this
function multiple times and pass the same (nonnegative) fake port index, the same object will be
returned, and this object is not reference counted.<br />
<br />
To create a "client" port (e.g. the equivalent of an ephemeral UDP port) pass -1. In this case, a
distinct object will be returned for each call. When the peer receives packets sent from this
interface, the peer will assign a FakeIP from its own locally-controlled namespace.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="2"></a>Callback structures</h2>
<h2 class="bb_subsection">
    <a name="SteamNetConnectionStatusChangedCallback_t"></a
    >SteamNetConnectionStatusChangedCallback_t
</h2>
This callback is posted whenever a connection is created, destroyed, or changes state. The m_info
field will contain a complete description of the connection at the time the change occurred and the
callback was posted. In particular, m_info.m_eState will have the new connection state.<br />
<br />
You will usually need to listen for this callback to know when:<br />
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>A new connection arrives on a listen socket.</strong> m_info.m_hListenSocket will be
        set, m_eOldState = k_ESteamNetworkingConnectionState_None, and m_info.m_eState =
        k_ESteamNetworkingConnectionState_Connecting. See
        <a href="/doc/api/ISteamNetworkingSockets#AcceptConnection"
            >ISteamNetworkingSockets::AcceptConnection</a
        >.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>A connection you initiated has been accepted by the remote host.</strong>
        m_eOldState = k_ESteamNetworkingConnectionState_Connecting, and m_info.m_eState =
        k_ESteamNetworkingConnectionState_Connected. Some connections might transition to
        k_ESteamNetworkingConnectionState_FindingRoute first.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>A connection has been actively rejected or closed by the remote host.</strong>
        m_eOldState = k_ESteamNetworkingConnectionState_Connecting or
        k_ESteamNetworkingConnectionState_Connected, and m_info.m_eState =
        k_ESteamNetworkingConnectionState_ClosedByPeer. m_info.m_eEndReason and m_info.m_szEndDebug
        will have more details. NOTE: upon receiving this callback, you <i>must</i> still destroy
        the connection using
        <a href="/doc/api/ISteamNetworkingSockets#CloseConnection"
            >ISteamNetworkingSockets::CloseConnection</a
        >
        to free up local resources. (The details passed to the function are not used in this case,
        since the connection is already closed.)<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong
            >A problem was detected with the connection, and it has been closed by the local
            host.</strong
        >
        The most common failure is timeout, but other configuration or authentication failures can
        cause this. m_eOldState = k_ESteamNetworkingConnectionState_Connecting or
        k_ESteamNetworkingConnectionState_Connected, and m_info.m_eState =
        k_ESteamNetworkingConnectionState_ProblemDetectedLocally. m_info.m_eEndReason and
        m_info.m_szEndDebug will have more details. NOTE: upon receiving this callback, you
        <i>must</i> still destroy the connection using
        <a href="/doc/api/ISteamNetworkingSockets#CloseConnection"
            >ISteamNetworkingSockets::CloseConnection</a
        >
        to free up local resources. (The details passed to the function are not used in this case,
        since the connection is already closed.)
    </li>
</ul>
<br />
Remember that callbacks are posted to a queue, and networking connections can change at any time. It
is possible that the connection has already changed state by the time you process this callback.<br />
<br />
Also note that callbacks will be posted when connections are created and destroyed by your own API
calls.<br />

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="custom_signaling"></a>Custom P2P signaling</h2>
<i>Signaling</i> refers to rendezvous messages sent through a trusted channel that is low bandwidth
and high latency, used by peers to negotiate a P2P connection. Steam provides a signaling service
for you. However, in some situations you may wish to do your own signaling. (For example, if one or
both of your peers are not on Steam.) You can use SteamNetworkingSockets to make P2P connections,
with your own signaling. You can use ICE to pierce NAT and use standard STUN/TURN servers, or
depending on your situation, SDR relay network and Valve backbone may not be available. Please let
us know if you need more information about these APIs.<br />
