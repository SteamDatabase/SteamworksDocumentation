Member functions for <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">ISteamTimeline</code> are
called through the global accessor function

Sets a description <strong><span style="color: #ffd55f">(B)</span></strong> for the current game
state in the timeline. These help the user to find specific<br />
moments in the timeline when saving clips. Setting a new state description replaces any previous<br />
description.<br />

Examples could include:<br />

    <li>Where the user is in the world in a single player game<br /></li>
    <li>Which round is happening in a multiplayer game<br /></li>
    <li>The current score for a sports game</li>

Use this to mark an event <strong><span style="color: #ffd55f">(A)</span></strong> on the Timeline.
This event will be instantaneous. (See
<a
    href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamTimeline#AddRangeTimelineEvent"
    class="bb_apilink"
    >ISteamTimeline::AddRangeTimelineEvent</a

Examples could include:<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>picking up a new weapon or ammo<br /></li>
    <li>scoring a goal</li>

<br />
The game can nominate an event as being suitable for a clip by passing
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">k_ETimelineEventClipPriority_Standard</code> or
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">k_ETimelineEventClipPriority_Featured</code> to
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">ePossibleClip</code>. Players can make clips of
their own at any point, but this lets the game suggest some options to Steam to make that process
easier for players.<br />

            One use of this parameter is to handle events whose significance is not clear until
            after the fact. For instance if the player starts a damage over time effect on another
            player, which kills them 3.5 seconds later, the game could pass -3.5 as the start offset
            and cause the event to appear in the timeline where the effect started.

<div class="bb_code cpp">void StartGamePhase();</div>
<br />
Use this to start a game phase. Game phases allow the user to navigate their background recordings
and clips. Exactly what a game phase means will vary game to game, but the game phase should be a
section of gameplay that is usually between 10 minutes and a few hours in length, and should be the
main way a user would think to divide up the game. These are presented to the user in a UI that
shows the date the game was played, with one row per game slice. Game phases should be used to mark
sections of gameplay that the user might be interested in watching.<br />
<br />
Examples could include:<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>A single match in a multiplayer PvP game<br /></li>
    <li>A chapter of a story-based singleplayer game<br /></li>
    <li>A single run in a roguelike</li>
</ul>
<br />
Game phases are started with StartGamePhase, and while a phase is still happening, they can have
tags and attributes added to them with
