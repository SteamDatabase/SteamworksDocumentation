<h1>ISteamRemoteStorage Interface</h1>
Provides functions for reading, writing, and accessing files which can be stored remotely in the
Steam Cloud.<br />
<br />
See
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/features/cloud" class="bb_doclink">Steam Cloud</a> for
more information.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="functions"></a>Member Functions</h2>
Member functions for <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">ISteamRemoteStorage</code> are
called through the global accessor function
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">SteamRemoteStorage()</code>.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="BeginFileWriteBatch"></a>BeginFileWriteBatch</h2>
<div class="bb_code cpp">bool BeginFileWriteBatch( );</div>
<br />
Use this along with
<a
    href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamRemoteStorage#EndFileWriteBatch"
    class="bb_apilink"
    >EndFileWriteBatch</a
>
to wrap a set of local file writes/deletes that should be considered part of one single state
change. For example, if saving game progress requires updating both
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">savegame1.dat</code> and
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">maxprogress.dat</code>, wrap those operations with
calls to <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">BeginFileWriteBatch</code> and
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">EndFileWriteBatch</code>.<br />
<br />
These functions provide a hint to Steam which will help it manage the app's Cloud files. Using these
functions is optional, however it will provide better reliability.<br />
<br />
Note that the functions may be used whether the writes are done using the
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">ISteamRemoteStorage</code> API, or done directly to
local disk (where AutoCloud is used). <br />
<br />
<strong>Returns:</strong> bool<br />
<strong>true</strong> if the write batch was begun, <strong>false</strong> if there was a batch
already in progress. <br />
<br />
<strong>Returns:</strong>
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/steam_api#SteamAPICall_t" class="bb_apilink"
    >SteamAPICall_t</a

to be used with a

call result.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="EndFileWriteBatch"></a>EndFileWriteBatch</h2>
<div class="bb_code cpp">bool EndFileWriteBatch( );</div>
<br />
Use this along with
<a
    href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamRemoteStorage#BeginFileWriteBatch"
    class="bb_apilink"
    >BeginFileWriteBatch</a
>
- see that documentation for more details.<br />
<br />
<strong>Returns:</strong> bool<br />
<strong>true</strong> if the write batch was ended, <strong>false</strong> if there was no batch
already in progress.

<br />
Deletes a file from the local disk, and propagates that delete to the cloud.<br />
<br />
This is meant to be used when a user actively deletes a file. Use
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamRemoteStorage#FileForget" class="bb_apilink"
    >ISteamRemoteStorage::FileForget</a
>
if you want to remove a file from the Steam Cloud but retain it on the users local disk.<br />
<br />
When a file has been deleted it can be re-written with
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamRemoteStorage#FileWrite" class="bb_apilink"
    >ISteamRemoteStorage::FileWrite</a
>
to reupload it to the Steam Cloud.<br />
<br />
<strong>Returns:</strong> bool<br />
<strong>true</strong> if the file exists and has been successfully deleted; otherwise,
<strong>false</strong> if the file did not exist.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="FileExists"></a>FileExists</h2>

Checks whether the specified file exists.<br />
<br />
<strong>Returns:</strong> bool<br />
<strong>true</strong> if the file exists; otherwise, <strong>false</strong>.

    </tr>

<br />
Deletes the file from remote storage, but leaves it on the local disk and remains accessible from
the API.<br />
<br />
When you are out of Cloud space, this can be used to allow calls to
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamRemoteStorage#FileWrite" class="bb_apilink"
    >ISteamRemoteStorage::FileWrite</a
>
to keep working without needing to make the user delete files.<br />
<br />
How you decide which files to forget are up to you. It could be a simple Least Recently Used (LRU)
queue or something more complicated.<br />
<br />
Requiring the user to manage their Cloud-ized files for a game, while is possible to do, it is never
recommended. For instance, "Which file would you like to delete so that you may store this new one?"
removes a significant advantage of using the Cloud in the first place: its transparency.<br />
<br />
Once a file has been deleted or forgotten, calling
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamRemoteStorage#FileWrite" class="bb_apilink"
    >ISteamRemoteStorage::FileWrite</a
>
will resynchronize it in the Cloud. Rewriting a forgotten file is the only way to make it persisted
again.<br />
<br />
<strong>Returns:</strong> bool<br />
<strong>true</strong> if the file exists and has been successfully forgotten; otherwise,
<strong>false</strong>.

Opens a binary file, reads the contents of the file into a byte array, and then closes the file.<br />
<br />
<strong>NOTE:</strong> This is a synchronous call and as such is a will block your calling thread on
the disk IO, and will also block the SteamAPI, which can cause other threads in your application to
block. To avoid "hitching" due to a busy disk on the client machine using
