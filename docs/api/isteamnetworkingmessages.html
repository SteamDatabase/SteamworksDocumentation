<h1>ISteamNetworkingMessages Interface</h1>
Networking API intended to make it easy to port non-connection-oriented code to take advantage of
P2P connectivity and
<a href="/doc/features/multiplayer/steamdatagramrelay">Steam Datagram Relay</a>. <br />
<br />
<a href="/doc/api/ISteamNetworkingSockets">ISteamNetworkingSockets</a> is connection-oriented (like
TCP), meaning you need to listen and connect, and then you send messages using a connection handle.
ISteamNetworkingMessages, on the other hand, is more like UDP, in that you can just send messages to
arbitrary peers at any time. The underlying connections are established implicitly.<br />
<br />
Under the hood ISteamNetworkingMessages works on top of the
<a href="/doc/api/ISteamNetworkingSockets">ISteamNetworkingSockets</a> code, so you get the same
routing and messaging efficiency. The difference is mainly in your responsibility to explicitly
establish a connection and the type of feedback you get about the state of the connection. Both
interfaces can do "P2P" communications, both support both unreliable and reliable messages,
fragmentation and reassembly, and both can be used to take advantage of
<a href="/doc/features/multiplayer/steamdatagramrelay">Steam Datagram Relay</a> to talk to dedicated
servers.<br />
<br />
The primary purpose of this interface is to be "like UDP", so that UDP-based code can be ported
easily to take advantage of relayed connections. If you find yourself needing more low level
information or control, or to be able to better handle failure, then you probably need to use
<a href="/doc/api/ISteamNetworkingSockets">ISteamNetworkingSockets</a> directly. Also, note that if
your main goal is to obtain a connection between two peers without concerning yourself with
assigning roles of "client" and "server", you may find the symmetric connection mode of
ISteamNetworkingSockets useful.<br />
(See k_ESteamNetworkingConfig_SymmetricConnect.)<br />
<br />
Member functions for ISteamNetworkingMessages are called through the global accessor function
SteamNetworkingMessages().
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="functions_sendrecv"></a>Sending and receiving messages</h2>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="SendMessageToUser"></a>SendMessageToUser</h2>
<div class="bb_code cpp">
    EResult SendMessageToUser( const SteamNetworkingIdentity &amp;identityRemote, const void
    *pubData, uint32 cubData, int nSendFlags, int nRemoteChannel );
</div>
<br />
Sends a message to the specified host. If we don't already have a session with that user, a session
is implicitly created. There might be some handshaking that needs to happen before we can actually
begin sending message data. If this handshaking fails and we can't get through, an error will be
posted via the callback
<a href="/doc/api/ISteamNetworkingMessages#SteamNetworkingMessagesSessionFailed_t"
    >SteamNetworkingMessagesSessionFailed_t</a
>. <br />
There is no notification when the operation succeeds. (You should have the peer send a reply for
this purpose.)<br />
<br />
Sending a message to a host will also implicitly accept any incoming connection from that host.<br />
<br />
nSendFlags is a bitmask of
<a href="/doc/api/steamnetworkingtypes#message_sending_flags">k_nSteamNetworkingSend_xxx</a>
options<br />
<br />
nRemoteChannel is a routing number you can use to help route message to different systems. <br />
You'll have to call
<a href="/doc/api/ISteamNetworkingMessages#ReceiveMessagesOnChannel"
    >ISteamNetworkingMessages::ReceiveMessagesOnChannel</a
>
with the same channel number in order to retrieve the data on the other end.<br />
<br />
Using different channels to talk to the same user will still use the same underlying connection,
saving on resources. If you don't need this feature, use 0. Otherwise, small integers are the most
efficient.<br />
<br />
It is guaranteed that reliable messages to the same host on the same channel will be be received by
the remote host (if they are received at all) exactly once, and in the same order that they were
sent.<br />
<br />
NO other order guarantees exist! In particular, unreliable messages may be dropped, received out of
order with respect to each other and with respect to reliable data, or may be received multiple
times. Messages on different channels are *not* guaranteed to be received in the order they were
sent.<br />
<br />
A note for those familiar with TCP/IP ports, or converting an existing codebase that opened multiple
sockets: You might notice that there is only one channel, and with TCP/IP each endpoint has a port
number. You can think of the channel number as the <i>destination</i> port. If you need each message
to also include a <i>source port</i> (so the recipient can route the reply), then just put that in
your message. That is essentially how UDP works!<br />
<br />
Returns:<br />
<ul>
    <li>k_EREsultOK on success.<br /></li>
    <li>
        k_EResultNoConnection, if the session has failed or was closed by the peer and
        k_nSteamNetworkingSend_AutoRestartBrokenSession was not specified. (You can<br />
        use <a href="/doc/api/GetSessionConnectionInfo">GetSessionConnectionInfo</a> to get the
        details.) In order to acknowledge the broken session and start a new one, you must call
        <a href="/doc/api/CloseSessionWithUser">CloseSessionWithUser</a>, or you may repeat the call
        with k_nSteamNetworkingSend_AutoRestartBrokenSession. See
        k_nSteamNetworkingSend_AutoRestartBrokenSession for more details.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        k_EResultNoConnection will be returned if the session has failed or was closed by the peer,
        and k_nSteamNetworkingSend_AutoRestartBrokenSession is not used. (You can use
        <a href="/doc/api/ISteamNetworkingMessages#GetSessionConnectionInfo"
            >ISteamNetworkingMessages::GetSessionConnectionInfo</a
        >
        to get the details.) In order to acknowledge the broken session and start a new one, you
        must call
        <a href="/doc/api/ISteamNetworkingMessages#CloseSessionWithUser"
            >ISteamNetworkingMessages::CloseSessionWithUser</a
        ><br />
    </li>
    <li>
        See
        <a href="/doc/api/ISteamNetworkingSockets#SendMessageToConnection"
            >ISteamNetworkingSockets::SendMessageToConnection</a
        >
        for more possible return values.

</ul>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="ReceiveMessagesOnChannel"></a>ReceiveMessagesOnChannel</h2>
<div class="bb_code cpp">
    int ReceiveMessagesOnChannel( int nLocalChannel, SteamNetworkingMessage_t **ppOutMessages, int
    nMaxMessages );
</div>
<br />
Reads the next message that has been sent from another user via SendMessageToUser() on the given
channel. Returns number of messages returned into your list. (0 if no message are available on that
channel.)<br />
<br />
When you're done with the message object(s), make sure and call SteamNetworkingMessage_t::Release!
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="functions_manage_sessions"></a>Managing sessions with peers</h2>
<br />
Although this API allows for sending messages to peers ad-hoc, under the hood
ISteamNetworkingSockets connections are used. We refer to these connections as "sessions" in this
context. However, when a remote peer initiates contact, no messages can be received from the peer
until the session is accepted, either by sending outbound communications to the peer, or with
<a href="/doc/api/ISteamNetworkingMessages#AcceptSessionWithUser"
    >ISteamNetworkingMessages::AcceptSessionWithUser</a
>. Sessions automatically time out when communications are idle, but you can terminate them early to
free up resources, when you know you are finished.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="AcceptSessionWithUser"></a>AcceptSessionWithUser</h2>
<div class="bb_code cpp">
    bool AcceptSessionWithUser( const SteamNetworkingIdentity &amp;identityRemote );
</div>
<br />
Call this in response to a
<a href="/doc/api/ISteamNetworkingMessages#SteamNetworkingMessagesSessionRequest_t"
    >SteamNetworkingMessagesSessionRequest_t</a
>
callback.<br />
SteamNetworkingMessagesSessionRequest_t are posted when a user tries to send you a message, and you
haven't tried to talk to them first. If you don't want to talk to them, just ignore the request. If
the user continues to send you messages, SteamNetworkingMessagesSessionRequest_t callbacks will
continue to be posted periodically.<br />
<br />
Returns false if there is no session with the user pending or otherwise. If there is an existing
active session, this function will return true, even if it is not pending.<br />
<br />
Calling
<a href="/doc/api/ISteamNetworkingMessages#SendMessageToUser"
    >ISteamNetworkingMessages::SendMessageToUser</a
>
will implicitly accepts any pending session request to that user.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="CloseSessionWithUser"></a>CloseSessionWithUser</h2>
<div class="bb_code cpp">
    bool CloseSessionWithUser( const SteamNetworkingIdentity &amp;identityRemote );
</div>
<br />
<br />
Call this when you're done talking to a user to immediately free up resources under-the-hood. If the
remote user tries to send data to you again, another
<a href="/doc/api/ISteamNetworkingMessages#SteamNetworkingMessagesSessionRequest_t"
    >SteamNetworkingMessagesSessionRequest_t</a
>
callback will be posted.<br />
<br />
Note that sessions that go unused for a few minutes are automatically timed out.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="CloseChannelWithUser"></a>CloseChannelWithUser</h2>
<div class="bb_code cpp">
    bool CloseChannelWithUser( const SteamNetworkingIdentity &amp;identityRemote, int nLocalChannel
    );
</div>
<br />
Call this when you're done talking to a user on a specific channel. Once all open channels to a user
have been closed, the open session to the user will be closed, and any new data from this user will
trigger a
<a href="/doc/api/ISteamNetworkingMessages#SteamNetworkingMessagesSessionRequest_t"
    >SteamNetworkingMessagesSessionRequest_t</a
><br />
callback
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="GetSessionConnectionInfo"></a>GetSessionConnectionInfo</h2>
<div class="bb_code cpp">
    ESteamNetworkingConnectionState GetSessionConnectionInfo( const SteamNetworkingIdentity
    &amp;identityRemote, SteamNetConnectionInfo_t *pConnectionInfo,
    SteamNetConnectionRealTimeStatus_t *pQuickStatus );
</div>
<br />
Returns information about the latest state of a connection, if any, with the given peer. Primarily
intended for debugging purposes, but can also be used to get more detailed failure information.<br />
(See
<a href="/doc/api/ISteamnetworkingMessages#SendMessageToUser"
    >ISteamnetworkingMessages::SendMessageToUser</a
>
and k_nSteamNetworkingSend_AutoRestartBrokenSession.)<br />
<br />
Returns the value of
<a href="/doc/api/steamnetworkingtyupes#SteamNetConnectionInfo_t">SteamNetConnectionInfo_t</a
>::m_eState, or k_ESteamNetworkingConnectionState_None if no connection exists with specified peer.
You may pass nullptr for either parameter if you do not need the corresponding details. Note that
sessions time out after a while, so if a connection fails, or
<a href="/doc/api/ISteamNetworkingMessages#SendMessageToUser"
    >ISteamNetworkingMessages::SendMessageToUser</a
>
returns k_EResultNoConnection, you cannot wait indefinitely to obtain the reason for failure.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Callback structures</h2>
<h2 class="bb_subsection">
    <a name="SteamNetworkingMessagesSessionRequest_t"></a>SteamNetworkingMessagesSessionRequest_t
</h2>
<br />
Posted when a remote host is sending us a message, and we do not already have a session with them<br />
<br />
<div class="bb_code">
    struct SteamNetworkingMessagesSessionRequest_t { /// User who wants to talk to us
    SteamNetworkingIdentity m_identityRemote; };
</div>
<h2 class="bb_subsection">
    <a name="SteamNetworkingMessagesSessionFailed_t"></a>SteamNetworkingMessagesSessionFailed_t
</h2>
<br />
Posted when we fail to establish a connection, or we detect that communications have been disrupted
it an unusual way. There is no notification when a peer proactively closes the session. ("Closed by
peer" is not a concept of UDP-style communications, and ISteamNetworkingMessages is primarily
intended to make porting UDP code easy.)<br />
<br />
Remember: callbacks are asynchronous. See notes on
<a href="/doc/api/ISteamNetworkingMessages#SendMessageToUser"
    >ISteamNetworkingMessages::SendMessageToUser</a
>, and k_nSteamNetworkingSend_AutoRestartBrokenSession in particular.<br />
<br />
Also, if a session times out due to inactivity, no callbacks will be posted. The only way to detect
that this is happening is that querying the session state may return none, connecting, and
findingroute again.<br />
<div class="bb_code">
    struct SteamNetworkingMessagesSessionFailed_t { /// Detailed info about the session that failed.
    /// SteamNetConnectionInfo_t::m_identityRemote indicates who this session /// was with.
    SteamNetConnectionInfo_t m_info; };
</div>
