<h1>ISteamParties Interface</h1>
This API can be used to selectively advertise your multiplayer game session in a Steam chat room
group. Tell Steam the number of player spots that are available for your party, and a join-game
string, and it will show a beacon in the selected group and allow that many users to “follow” the
beacon to your party. Adjust the number of open slots if other players join through alternate
matchmaking methods. <br />
<br />
For example, you can use ISteamParties in conjunction with a private lobby. Create a private lobby,
and then use <a href="/doc/api/ISteamParties#CreateBeacon">ISteamParties::CreateBeacon</a> to create
a party "beacon" for the number of players desired. The game connect string should indicate the ID
of the private lobby. <br />
<br />
The beacon will appear in Steam in the specified location (e.g. a Chat Room Group), and also via the
in-game ISteamParties API as described below. Steam creates "reservation" slots for the number of
desired players. Whenever a user follows the beacon, Steam will hold a reservation slot for them and
launch the game using the given connect string. <br />
<br />
The game session that created the beacon will be notified of this reservation, so the game can
display the appropriate "User &lt;username&gt; is joining your party" or some other indicator. Once
the user joins successfully, the game session should call
<a href="/doc/api/ISteamParties#OnReservationCompleted">ISteamParties::OnReservationCompleted</a> to
tell Steam that the user successfully joined (otherwise, Steam will eventually timeout their
reservation and re-open the slot). <br />
<br />
When all of the beacon slots are occupied - either by reservations for users still launching the
game, or completed slots for users in the party - Steam will hide and disable the beacon. <br />
<br />
To cancel the beacon - for instance when the party is full and the game begins - call
<a href="/doc/api/ISteamParties#DestroyBeacon">ISteamParties::DestroyBeacon</a>.<br />
<br />
The client side of this operation - seeing and following beacons - can also be managed by your game.
Using
<a href="/doc/api/ISteamParties#GetNumActiveBeacons">ISteamParties::GetNumActiveBeacons</a> and
<a href="/doc/api/ISteamParties#GetBeaconDetails">ISteamParties::GetBeaconDetails</a>, your game can
get a list of beacons from other users that are currently active in locations relevant to the
current user. If the user desires, call
<a href="/doc/api/ISteamParties#JoinParty">ISteamParties::JoinParty</a> to "follow" one of those
beacons.

If a user joins your party through other matchmaking (perhaps a direct Steam friend, or your own
matchmaking system), your game should reduce the number of open slots that Steam is managing through
the party beacon. For example, if you created a beacon with five slots, and Steam sent you two
<a href="/doc/api/ReservationNotificationCallback_t">ReservationNotificationCallback_t</a>
callbacks, and then a third user joined directly, you would want to call
<strong>ChangeNumOpenSlots</strong> with a value of 2 for unOpenSlots. That value represents the
total number of <i>new</i> users that you would like Steam to send to your party.<br />

Call this method to destroy the Steam party beacon. This will immediately cause Steam to stop
showing the beacon in the target location. Note that any users currently in-flight may still arrive
at your party expecting to join.<br />
<br />
Your game should call this method when either the party has been filled and the game is beginning,
or the user has decided to abandon creating a party. The beacon will be destroyed automatically when
your game exits, but the preferred behavior is for the game to call
<strong>DestroyBeacon</strong> at the right time.<br />

After creating a beacon, when a user "follows" that beacon Steam will send you this callback to know
that you should be prepared for the user to join your game. When they do join, be sure to call
<a href="/doc/api/ISteamParties#OnReservationCompleted">ISteamParties::OnReservationCompleted</a> to
let Steam know.<br />
