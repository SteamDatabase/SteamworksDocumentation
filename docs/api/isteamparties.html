<h1>ISteamParties Interface</h1>
This API can be used to selectively advertise your multiplayer game session in a
Steam chat room group. Tell Steam the number of player spots that are available
for your party, and a join-game string, and it will show a beacon in the
selected group and allow that many users to “follow” the beacon to your party.
Adjust the number of open slots if other players join through alternate
matchmaking methods. <br /><br />For example, you can use ISteamParties in
conjunction with a private lobby. Create a private lobby, and then use
<a
  href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamParties#CreateBeacon"
  class="bb_apilink"
  >ISteamParties::CreateBeacon</a
>
to create a party "beacon" for the number of players desired. The game connect
string should indicate the ID of the private lobby. <br /><br />The beacon will
appear in Steam in the specified location (e.g. a Chat Room Group), and also via
the in-game ISteamParties API as described below. Steam creates "reservation"
slots for the number of desired players. Whenever a user follows the beacon,
Steam will hold a reservation slot for them and launch the game using the given
connect string. <br /><br />The game session that created the beacon will be
notified of this reservation, so the game can display the appropriate "User
&lt;username&gt; is joining your party" or some other indicator. Once the user
joins successfully, the game session should call
<a
  href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamParties#OnReservationCompleted"
  class="bb_apilink"
  >ISteamParties::OnReservationCompleted</a
>
to tell Steam that the user successfully joined (otherwise, Steam will
eventually timeout their reservation and re-open the slot). <br /><br />When all
of the beacon slots are occupied - either by reservations for users still
launching the game, or completed slots for users in the party - Steam will hide
and disable the beacon. <br /><br />To cancel the beacon - for instance when the
party is full and the game begins - call
<a
  href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamParties#DestroyBeacon"
  class="bb_apilink"
  >ISteamParties::DestroyBeacon</a
>.<br /><br />The client side of this operation - seeing and following beacons -
can also be managed by your game. Using
<a
  href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamParties#GetNumActiveBeacons"
  class="bb_apilink"
  >ISteamParties::GetNumActiveBeacons</a
>
and
<a
  href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamParties#GetBeaconDetails"
  class="bb_apilink"
  >ISteamParties::GetBeaconDetails</a
>, your game can get a list of beacons from other users that are currently
active in locations relevant to the current user. If the user desires, call
<a
  href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamParties#JoinParty"
  class="bb_apilink"
  >ISteamParties::JoinParty</a
>
to "follow" one of those beacons.
