Member functions for ISteamNetworkingUtils are called through the global accessor function
SteamNetworkingUtils().
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="functions_initialization"></a>Initialization and status check</h2>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="InitRelayNetworkAccess"></a>InitRelayNetworkAccess</h2>
<div class="bb_code cpp">void InitRelayNetworkAccess();</div>
If you know that you are going to be using the relay network (for example, because you anticipate
making P2P connections), call this to initialize the relay network. If you do not call this, the
initialization will be delayed until the first time you use a feature that requires access to the
relay network, which will delay that first access.<br />
<br />
You can also call this to force a retry if the previous attempt has failed. Performing any action
that requires access to the relay network will also trigger a retry, and so calling this function is
never strictly necessary, but it can be useful to call it a program launch time, if access to the
relay network is anticipated. Use
<a href="/doc/api/ISteamNetworkingUtils#GetRelayNetworkStatus"
    >ISteamNetworkingUtils::GetRelayNetworkStatus</a
>
or listen for
<a href="/doc/api/steamnetworkingtypes#SteamRelayNetworkStatus_t ">SteamRelayNetworkStatus_t </a>
callbacks to know when initialization has completed. Typically initialization completes in a few
seconds.<br />
<br />
Note: dedicated servers hosted in known data centers do *not* need to call this, since they do not
make routing decisions. However, if the dedicated server will be using P2P functionality, it will
act as a "client" and this should be called.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="GetRelayNetworkStatus"></a>GetRelayNetworkStatus</h2>
<div class="bb_code">
    ESteamNetworkingAvailability GetRelayNetworkStatus( SteamRelayNetworkStatus_t *pDetails );
</div>
Fetch current status of the relay network.<br />
<br />
<a href="/doc/api/steamnetworkingtypes#SteamRelayNetworkStatus_t">SteamRelayNetworkStatus_t</a> is
also a callback. It will be triggered on both the user and gameserver interfaces any time the status
changes, or ping measurement starts or stops.<br />
<br />
SteamRelayNetworkStatus_t::m_eAvail is returned. If you want more details, you can pass a non-NULL
value.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="functions_ping_location"></a>Ping Location Functions</h2>
<br />
We use the ping times to the valve relays deployed worldwide to generate a "marker" that describes
the location of an Internet host. Given two such markers, we can estimate the network latency
between two hosts, without sending any packets. The estimate is based on the optimal route that is
found through the Valve network. If you are using the Valve network to carry the traffic, then this
is precisely the ping you want. If you are not, then the ping time will probably still be a
reasonable estimate.<br />
<br />
This is extremely useful to select optional peers for matchmaking!<br />
<br />
The markers can also be converted to a string, so they can be transmitted. We have a separate
library you can use on your backend to manipulate these objects. (See
<a href="/doc/api/steamdatagramrelay">steamdatagramrelay</a>)
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="GetLocalPingLocation"></a>GetLocalPingLocation</h2>
<div class="bb_code cpp">float GetLocalPingLocation( SteamNetworkPingLocation_t &amp;result );</div>
<br />
Return location info for the current host. Returns the approximate age of the data, in seconds, or
-1 if no data is available.<br />
<br />
It takes a few seconds to initialize access to the relay network. If you call this very soon after
calling
<a href="/doc/api/ISteamNetworkingUtils#InitializeRelayNetworkAccess"
    >ISteamNetworkingUtils::InitializeRelayNetworkAccess</a
>, the data may not be available yet.<br />
<br />
This always return the most up-to-date information we have available right now, even if we are in
the middle of re-calculating ping times.
<h2 class="bb_subsection">
    <a name="EstimatePingTimeBetweenTwoLocations"></a>EstimatePingTimeBetweenTwoLocations
</h2>
<div class="bb_code cpp">
    int EstimatePingTimeBetweenTwoLocations( const SteamNetworkPingLocation_t &amp;location1, const
    SteamNetworkPingLocation_t &amp;location2 );
</div>
<br />
Estimate the round-trip latency between two arbitrary locations, in milliseconds. This is a
conservative estimate, based on routing through the relay network. For most basic relayed
connections, this ping time will be pretty accurate, since it will be based on the route likely to
be actually used.<br />
<br />
If a direct IP route is used (perhaps via NAT traversal), then the route will be different, and the
ping time might be better. Or it might actually be a bit worse! Standard IP routing is frequently
suboptimal!<br />
<br />
But even in this case, the estimate obtained using this method is a reasonable upper bound on the
ping time. (Also it has the advantage of returning immediately and not sending any packets.)<br />
<br />
In a few cases we might not able to estimate the route. In this case a negative value is returned.
k_nSteamNetworkingPing_Failed means the reason was because of some networking difficulty. (Failure
to ping, etc) k_nSteamNetworkingPing_Unknown is returned if we cannot currently answer the question
for some other reason.<br />
<br />
Do you need to be able to do this from a backend/matchmaking server? You are looking for the "game
coordinator" library. See <a href="/doc/api/steamdatagramrelay">steamdatagramrelay</a> for more info
on how to obtain the game coordinator SDK.
<h2 class="bb_subsection">
    <a name="EstimatePingTimeFromLocalHost"></a>EstimatePingTimeFromLocalHost
</h2>
<div class="bb_code cpp">
    int EstimatePingTimeFromLocalHost( const SteamNetworkPingLocation_t &amp;remoteLocation );
</div>
Same as EstimatePingTime, but assumes that one location is the local host. This is a bit faster,
especially if you need to calculate a bunch of these in a loop to find the fastest one.<br />
<br />
In rare cases this might return a slightly different estimate than combining GetLocalPingLocation
with EstimatePingTimeBetweenTwoLocations. That's because this function uses a slightly more complete
set of information about what route would be taken.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="ConvertPingLocationToString"></a>ConvertPingLocationToString</h2>
<div class="bb_code cpp">
    void ConvertPingLocationToString( const SteamNetworkPingLocation_t &amp;location, char *pszBuf,
    int cchBufSize );
</div>
Convert a ping location into a text format suitable for sending over the wire. The format is a
compact and human readable. However, it is subject to change so please do not parse it yourself.
Your buffer must be at least k_cchMaxSteamNetworkingPingLocationString bytes.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="ParsePingLocationString"></a>ParsePingLocationString</h2>
<div class="bb_code cpp">
    bool ParsePingLocationString( const char *pszString, SteamNetworkPingLocation_t &amp;result );
</div>
Parse back SteamNetworkPingLocation_t string. Returns false if we couldn't understand the string.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="ping_status_functions"></a>Ping Measurement Status Functions</h2>
<br />
Using the relay network requires latency measurements be taken. Aside from calling
<a href="/doc/api/ISteamNetworkingUtils#InitializeRelayNetworkAccess"
    >ISteamNetworkingUtils::InitializeRelayNetworkAccess</a
>
when your application boots (if you know you will need access to the relay network to send traffic
or just estimate pings), the latency gathering process will happen automatically. These functions
allow a bit more control over the process.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="CheckPingDataUpToDate"></a>CheckPingDataUpToDate</h2>
<div class="bb_code cpp">bool CheckPingDataUpToDate( float flMaxAgeSeconds );</div>
Check if the ping data of sufficient recency is available, and if it's too old, start refreshing
it.<br />
<br />
Please only call this function when you <i>really</i> do need to force an immediate refresh of the
data. (For example, in response to a specific user input to refresh this information.) Don't call it
"just in case", before every connection, etc. That will cause extra traffic to be sent for no
benefit. The library will automatically refresh the information as needed.<br />
<br />
Returns true if sufficiently recent data is already available.<br />
<br />
Returns false if sufficiently recent data is not available. In this case, ping measurement is
initiated, if it is not already active. (You cannot restart a measurement already in progress.)
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="IsPingMeasurementInProgress"></a>IsPingMeasurementInProgress</h2>
<div class="bb_code cpp">bool IsPingMeasurementInProgress();</div>
Return true if we are taking ping measurements to update our ping location or select optimal
routing. Ping measurement typically takes a few seconds, perhaps up to 10 seconds.
<h2 class="bb_section">
    <a name="functions_valve_network_topology"></a>Valve Network Topology Functions
</h2>
<br />
List of Valve points of presence ("POP"), and ping times to them. This might be useful to you if you
are use our hosting, or just need to measure latency to a cloud data center where we are running
relays.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="GetPingToDataCenter"></a>GetPingToDataCenter</h2>
<div class="bb_code cpp">
    int GetPingToDataCenter( SteamNetworkingPOPID popID, SteamNetworkingPOPID *pViaRelayPoP );
</div>
Fetch ping time of best available relayed route from this host to the specified data center.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="GetDirectPingToPOP"></a>GetDirectPingToPOP</h2>
<div class="bb_code cpp">int GetDirectPingToPOP( SteamNetworkingPOPID popID );</div>
Get *direct* ping time to the relays at the point of presence.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="GetPOPCount"></a>GetPOPCount</h2>
<div class="bb_code cpp">int GetPOPCount();</div>
Get number of network points of presence in the config
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="GetPOPList"></a>GetPOPList</h2>
<div class="bb_code cpp">int GetPOPList( SteamNetworkingPOPID *list, int nListSz );</div>
Get list of all POP IDs. Returns the number of entries that were filled into your list.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="functions_ping_location"></a>Config Functions</h2>
<br />
Control networking options. See ESteamNetworkingConfigValue for individual descriptions.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="SetConfigValue"></a>SetConfigValue</h2>
<div class="bb_code cpp">
    bool SetConfigValue( ESteamNetworkingConfigValue eValue, ESteamNetworkingConfigScope eScopeType,
    intptr_t scopeObj, ESteamNetworkingConfigDataType eDataType, const void *pArg );
</div>
<br />
<br />
Set a configuration value.<br />
<ul>
    <li>eValue: which value is being set<br /></li>
    <li>eScope: Onto what type of object are you applying the setting?<br /></li>
    <li>
        scopeArg: Which object you want to change? (Ignored for global scope). E.g. connection
        handle, listen socket handle, interface pointer, etc.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        eDataType: What type of data is in the buffer at pValue? This must match the type of the
        variable exactly!<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        pArg: Value to set it to.<br />
        <br />
        You can pass NULL to remove a non-global setting at this scope, causing the value for that
        object to use global defaults. Or at global scope, passing NULL will reset any custom value
        and restore it to the system default.<br />
        <br />
        NOTE: When setting pointers (e.g. callback functions), do not pass the function pointer
        directly. Your argument should be a pointer to a function pointer.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="char"></a>char</h2>
<div class="bb_code cpp">
    const char *GetConfigValueInfo( ESteamNetworkingConfigValue eValue,
    ESteamNetworkingConfigDataType *pOutDataType, ESteamNetworkingConfigScope *pOutScope );
</div>
<br />
Get info about a configuration value. Returns the name of the value, or NULL if the value doesn't
exist. Other output parameters can be NULL if you do not need them.
<h2 class="bb_subsection">
    <a name="IterateGenericEditableConfigValues"></a>IterateGenericEditableConfigValues
</h2>
<div class="bb_code cpp">
    ESteamNetworkingConfigValue IterateGenericEditableConfigValues( ESteamNetworkingConfigValue
    eCurrent, bool bEnumerateDevVars );
</div>
<br />
Iterate the list of all configuration values in the current environment that it might be possible to
display or edit using a generic UI. To get the first iterable value, pass
k_ESteamNetworkingConfig_Invalid. Returns k_ESteamNetworkingConfig_Invalid to signal end of list.<br />
<br />
The bEnumerateDevVars argument can be used to include "dev" vars. These are vars that are
recommended to only be editable in "debug" or "dev" mode and typically should not be shown in a
retail environment where a malicious local user might use this to cheat.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="shortcuts"></a>Shortcuts for common cases</h2>
The following functions are handy shortcuts for common use cases.<br />
<div class="bb_code cpp">
    bool SetGlobalConfigValueInt32( ESteamNetworkingConfigValue eValue, int32 val ); bool
    SetGlobalConfigValueFloat( ESteamNetworkingConfigValue eValue, float val ); bool
    SetGlobalConfigValueString( ESteamNetworkingConfigValue eValue, const char *val ); bool
    SetConnectionConfigValueInt32( HSteamNetConnection hConn, ESteamNetworkingConfigValue eValue,
    int32 val ); bool SetConnectionConfigValueFloat( HSteamNetConnection hConn,
    ESteamNetworkingConfigValue eValue, float val ); bool SetConnectionConfigValueString(
    HSteamNetConnection hConn, ESteamNetworkingConfigValue eValue, const char *val );
</div>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="functions_misc"></a>Misc Functions</h2>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="AllocateMessage"></a>AllocateMessage</h2>
<div class="bb_code">SteamNetworkingMessage_t *AllocateMessage( int cbAllocateBuffer )</div>
Allocate and initialize a message object. Usually the reason you call this is to pass it to
<a href="/doc/api/ISteamNetworkingSockets#SendMessages">ISteamNetworkingSockets::SendMessages</a>.
The returned object will have all of the relevant fields cleared to zero.<br />
<br />
Optionally you can also request that this system allocate space to hold the payload itself. If
cbAllocateBuffer is nonzero, the system will allocate memory to hold a payload of at least
cbAllocateBuffer bytes. m_pData will point to the allocated buffer, m_cbSize will be set to the
size, and m_pfnFreeData will be set to the proper function to free up the buffer.<br />
<br />
If cbAllocateBuffer=0, then no buffer is allocated. m_pData will be NULL, m_cbSize will be zero, and
m_pfnFreeData will be NULL. You will need to set each of these.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="GetLocalTimestamp"></a>GetLocalTimestamp</h2>
<div class="bb_code cpp">SteamNetworkingMicroseconds GetLocalTimestamp();</div>
<br />
A general purpose high resolution local timer with the following properties:<br />
<ul>
    <li>Monotonicity is guaranteed.<br /></li>
    <li>
        The initial value will be at least 24*3600*30*1e6, i.e. about 30 days worth of microseconds.
        In this way, the timestamp value of 0 will always be at least "30 days ago". Also, negative
        numbers will never be returned.<br />
    </li>
    <li>Wraparound / overflow is not a practical concern.</li>
</ul>
<br />
SteamNetworkingMessage_t::m_usecTimeReceived contains a timestamp that is from the same timer.<br />
<br />
If you are running under the debugger and stop the process, the clock might not advance the full
wall clock time that has elapsed between calls. If the process is not blocked from normal operation,
the timestamp values will track wall clock time, even if you don't call the function frequently.<br />
<br />
The value is only meaningful for this run of the process. Don't compare it to values obtained on
another computer, or other runs of the same process.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="SetDebugOutputFunction"></a>SetDebugOutputFunction</h2>
<div class="bb_code cpp">
    void SetDebugOutputFunction( ESteamNetworkingSocketsDebugOutputType eDetailLevel,
    FSteamNetworkingSocketsDebugOutput pfnFunc );
</div>
<br />
Set a function to receive network-related information that is useful for debugging.<br />
<br />
This can be extremely useful during development, but it can also be useful for troubleshooting
problems with tech savvy end users. If you have a console or other log that customers can examine,
these log messages can often be helpful to troubleshoot network issues.(Especially any warning/error
messages.)<br />
<br />
The detail level indicates what message to invoke your callback on. Lower numeric value means more
important, and the value you pass is the lowest priority (highest numeric value) you wish to receive
callbacks for. Except when debugging, you should only use
k_ESteamNetworkingSocketsDebugOutputType_Msg or k_ESteamNetworkingSocketsDebugOutputType_Warning.
For best performance, do NOT request a high detail level and then filter out messages in your
callback. Instead, call this function to adjust the desired level of detail.<br />
<br />
The value here controls the detail level for most messages. You can control the detail level for
various subsystems (perhaps only for certain connections) by adjusting the configuration values
k_ESteamNetworkingConfig_LogLevel_Xxxxx.<br />
<br />
<strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: This may be called from a service thread, while we own a mutex, etc.
<i>Your callback function must be threadsafe and fast!</i> Do not make any other Steamworks calls
from within the handler.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Fake IP</h2>
<br />
The "FakeIP" system is useful for interfacing with code that assumes peers are identified using an
IPv4 address. See <a href="/doc/api/ISteamNetworkingSockets">ISteamNetworkingSockets</a> for more
information.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="IsFakeIPv4"></a>IsFakeIPv4</h2>
<div class="bb_code cpp">bool IsFakeIPv4( uint32 nIPv4 );</div>
<br />
Return true if an IPv4 address is one that might be used as a "fake" one. This function is fast; it
just does some logical tests on the IP and does not need to do any lookup operations.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="GetRealIdentityForFakeIP"></a>GetRealIdentityForFakeIP</h2>
<div class="bb_code cpp">
    EResult GetRealIdentityForFakeIP( const SteamNetworkingIPAddr &amp;fakeIP,
    SteamNetworkingIdentity *pOutRealIdentity );
</div>
<br />
Get the real identity associated with a given FakeIP.<br />
<br />
On failure, returns:<br />
<ul>
    <li>k_EResultInvalidParam: the IP is not a FakeIP.<br /></li>
    <li>
        k_EResultNoMatch: we don't recognize that FakeIP and don't know the corresponding identity.
    </li>
</ul>
<br />
FakeIP's used by active connections, or the FakeIPs assigned to local identities, will always work.
FakeIPs for recently destroyed connections will continue to return results for a little while, but
not forever. At some point, we will forget FakeIPs to save space. It's reasonably safe to assume
that you can read back the real identity of a connection very soon after it is destroyed. But do not
wait indefinitely.<br />
