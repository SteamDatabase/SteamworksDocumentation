<br />Member functions for ISteamNetworkingUtils are called through the global accessor function
SteamNetworkingUtils().
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="functions_initialization"></a>Initialization and status check</h2>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="InitRelayNetworkAccess"></a>InitiRelayNetworkAccess</h2>
<div class="bb_code cpp">void InitRelayNetworkAccess();</div>
If you know that you are going to be using the relay network (for example, because you anticipate
making P2P connections), call this to initialize the relay network. If you do not call this, the
initialization will be delayed until the first time you use a feature that requires access to the
relay network, which will delay that first access.<br /><br />You can also call this to force a
retry if the previous attempt has failed. Performing any action that requires access to the relay
network will also trigger a retry, and so calling this function is never strictly necessary, but it
can be useful to call it a program launch time, if access to the relay network is anticipated. Use
<a
    href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamNetworkingUtils#GetRelayNetworkStatus"
    class="bb_apilink"
    >ISteamNetworkingUtils::GetRelayNetworkStatus</a

or listen for
<a
    href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/steamnetworkingtypes#SteamRelayNetworkStatus_t%20"
    class="bb_apilink"
    >SteamRelayNetworkStatus_t
</a>
callbacks to know when initialization has completed. Typically initialization completes in a few
seconds.<br /><br />Note: dedicated servers hosted in known data centers do *not* need to call this,
since they do not make routing decisions. However, if the dedicated server will be using P2P
functionality, it will act as a "client" and this should be called.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="GetRelayNetworkStatus"></a>GetRelayNetworkStatus</h2>
<div class="bb_code ">
    ESteamNetworkingAvailability GetRelayNetworkStatus( SteamRelayNetworkStatus_t *pDetails );
</div>
Fetch current status of the relay network.<br /><br /><a
    href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/steamnetworkingtypes#SteamRelayNetworkStatus_t"
    class="bb_apilink"
    >SteamRelayNetworkStatus_t</a
>
is also a callback. It will be triggered on both the user and gameserver interfaces any time the
status changes, or ping measurement starts or stops.<br /><br />SteamRelayNetworkStatus_t::m_eAvail
is returned. If you want more details, you can pass a non-NULL value.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="functions_ping_location"></a>Ping Location Functions</h2>
<br />We use the ping times to the valve relays deployed worldwide to generate a "marker" that
describes the location of an Internet host. Given two such markers, we can estimate the network
latency between two hosts, without sending any packets. The estimate is based on the optimal route
that is found through the Valve network. If you are using the Valve network to carry the traffic,
then this is precisely the ping you want. If you are not, then the ping time will probably still be
a reasonable estimate.<br /><br />This is extremely useful to select optional peers for
matchmaking!<br /><br />The markers can also be converted to a string, so they can be transmitted.
We have a separate library you can use on your backend to manipulate these objects. (See
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/steamdatagramrelay" class="bb_apilink"
    >steamdatagramrelay</a
>)
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="GetLocalPingLocation"></a>GetLocalPingLocation</h2>
<div class="bb_code cpp">float GetLocalPingLocation( SteamNetworkPingLocation_t &amp;result );</div>
<br />Return location info for the current host. Returns the approximate age of the data, in
seconds, or -1 if no data is available.<br /><br />It takes a few seconds to initialize access to
the relay network. If you call this very soon after calling
<a
    href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamNetworkingUtils#InitializeRelayNetworkAccess"
    class="bb_apilink"
    >ISteamNetworkingUtils::InitializeRelayNetworkAccess</a
>, the data may not be available yet.<br /><br />This always return the most up-to-date information
we have available right now, even if we are in the middle of re-calculating ping times.
<h2 class="bb_subsection">
    <a name="EstimatePingTimeBetweenTwoLocations"></a>EstimatePingTimeBetweenTwoLocations
</h2>
<div class="bb_code cpp">
    int EstimatePingTimeBetweenTwoLocations( const SteamNetworkPingLocation_t &amp;location1, const
    SteamNetworkPingLocation_t &amp;location2 );
</div>
<br />Estimate the round-trip latency between two arbitrary locations, in milliseconds. This is a
conservative estimate, based on routing through the relay network. For most basic relayed
connections, this ping time will be pretty accurate, since it will be based on the route likely to
be actually used.<br /><br />If a direct IP route is used (perhaps via NAT traversal), then the
route will be different, and the ping time might be better. Or it might actually be a bit worse!
Standard IP routing is frequently suboptimal!<br /><br />But even in this case, the estimate
obtained using this method is a reasonable upper bound on the ping time. (Also it has the advantage
of returning immediately and not sending any packets.)<br /><br />In a few cases we might not able
to estimate the route. In this case a negative value is returned. k_nSteamNetworkingPing_Failed
means the reason was because of some networking difficulty. (Failure to ping, etc)
k_nSteamNetworkingPing_Unknown is returned if we cannot currently answer the question for some other
reason.<br /><br />Do you need to be able to do this from a backend/matchmaking server? You are
looking for the "game coordinator" library. See
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/steamdatagramrelay" class="bb_apilink"
    >steamdatagramrelay</a
>
for more info on how to obtain the game coordinator SDK.
<h2 class="bb_subsection">
    <a name="EstimatePingTimeFromLocalHost"></a>EstimatePingTimeFromLocalHost
</h2>
<div class="bb_code cpp">
    int EstimatePingTimeFromLocalHost( const SteamNetworkPingLocation_t &amp;remoteLocation );
</div>
Same as EstimatePingTime, but assumes that one location is the local host. This is a bit faster,
especially if you need to calculate a bunch of these in a loop to find the fastest one.<br /><br />In
rare cases this might return a slightly different estimate than combining GetLocalPingLocation with
EstimatePingTimeBetweenTwoLocations. That's because this function uses a slightly more complete set
of information about what route would be taken.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="ConvertPingLocationToString"></a>ConvertPingLocationToString</h2>
<div class="bb_code cpp">
    void ConvertPingLocationToString( const SteamNetworkPingLocation_t &amp;location, char *pszBuf,
    int cchBufSize );
</div>
Convert a ping location into a text format suitable for sending over the wire. The format is a
compact and human readable. However, it is subject to change so please do not parse it yourself.
Your buffer must be at least k_cchMaxSteamNetworkingPingLocationString bytes.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="ParsePingLocationString"></a>ParsePingLocationString</h2>
<div class="bb_code cpp">
    bool ParsePingLocationString( const char *pszString, SteamNetworkPingLocation_t &amp;result );
</div>
Parse back SteamNetworkPingLocation_t string. Returns false if we couldn't understand the string.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="ping_status_functions"></a>Ping Measurement Status Functions</h2>
<br />Using the relay network requires latency measurements be taken. Aside from calling
<a
    href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamNetworkingUtils#InitializeRelayNetworkAccess"
    class="bb_apilink"
    >ISteamNetworkingUtils::InitializeRelayNetworkAccess</a
>
when your application boots (if you know you will need access to the relay network to send traffic
or just estimate pings), the latency gathering process will happen automatically. These functions
allow a bit more control over the process.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="CheckPingDataUpToDate"></a>CheckPingDataUpToDate</h2>
<div class="bb_code cpp">bool CheckPingDataUpToDate( float flMaxAgeSeconds );</div>
Check if the ping data of sufficient recency is available, and if it's too old, start refreshing
it.<br /><br />Please only call this function when you <i>really</i> do need to force an immediate
refresh of the data. (For example, in response to a specific user input to refresh this
information.) Don't call it "just in case", before every connection, etc. That will cause extra
traffic to be sent for no benefit. The library will automatically refresh the information as
needed.<br /><br />Returns true if sufficiently recent data is already available.<br /><br />Returns
false if sufficiently recent data is not available. In this case, ping measurement is initiated, if
it is not already active. (You cannot restart a measurement already in progress.)
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="IsPingMeasurementInProgress"></a>IsPingMeasurementInProgress</h2>
<div class="bb_code cpp">bool IsPingMeasurementInProgress();</div>
Return true if we are taking ping measurements to update our ping location or select optimal
routing. Ping measurement typically takes a few seconds, perhaps up to 10 seconds.
<h2 class="bb_section">
    <a name="functions_valve_network_topology"></a>Valve Network Topology Functions
</h2>
<br />List of Valve points of presence ("POP"), and ping times to them. This might be useful to you
if you are use our hosting, or just need to measure latency to a cloud data center where we are
running relays.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="GetPingToDataCenter"></a>GetPingToDataCenter</h2>
<div class="bb_code cpp">
    int GetPingToDataCenter( SteamNetworkingPOPID popID, SteamNetworkingPOPID *pViaRelayPoP );
</div>
Fetch ping time of best available relayed route from this host to the specified data center.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="GetDirectPingToPOP"></a>GetDirectPingToPOP</h2>
<div class="bb_code cpp">int GetDirectPingToPOP( SteamNetworkingPOPID popID );</div>
Get *direct* ping time to the relays at the point of presence.

    </li>
    <li>
        pArg: Value to set it to.<br /><br />You can pass NULL to remove a non-global setting at
        this scope, causing the value for that object to use global defaults. Or at global scope,
        passing NULL will reset any custom value and restore it to the system default.<br /><br />NOTE:
        When setting callback functions, do not pass the function pointer directly. Your argument
        should be a pointer to a function pointer.

</div>
Returns info about a configuration value.<br /><br />Any of the output parameters can be NULL if you
do not need that information.<br /><br />pOutNextValue can be used to iterate through all of the
known configuration values. (Use GetFirstConfigValue() to begin the iteration, will be

<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="AllocateMessage"></a>AllocateMessage</h2>
<div class="bb_code ">SteamNetworkingMessage_t *AllocateMessage( int cbAllocateBuffer )</div>
Allocate and initialize a message object. Usually the reason you call this is to pass it to
<a
    href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamNetworkingSockets#SendMessages"
    class="bb_apilink"
    >ISteamNetworkingSockets::SendMessages</a
>. The returned object will have all of the relevant fields cleared to zero.<br /><br />Optionally
you can also request that this system allocate space to hold the payload itself. If cbAllocateBuffer
is nonzero, the system will allocate memory to hold a payload of at least cbAllocateBuffer bytes.
m_pData will point to the allocated buffer, m_cbSize will be set to the size, and m_pfnFreeData will
be set to the proper function to free up the buffer.<br /><br />If cbAllocateBuffer=0, then no
buffer is allocated. m_pData will be NULL, m_cbSize will be zero, and m_pfnFreeData will be NULL.
You will need to set each of these.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="GetLocalTimestamp"></a>GetLocalTimestamp</h2>
<div class="bb_code cpp">SteamNetworkingMicroseconds GetLocalTimestamp();</div>
<br />A general purpose high resolution local timer with the following properties:<br />
<ul class="bb_ul ">
    <li>Monotonicity is guaranteed.<br /></li>
    <li>
        The initial value will be at least 24*3600*30*1e6, i.e. about 30 days worth of microseconds.
        In this way, the timestamp value of 0 will always be at least "30 days ago". Also, negative
        numbers will never be returned.<br />
    </li>
    <li>Wraparound / overflow is not a practical concern.</li>
</ul>
<br />SteamNetworkingMessage_t::m_usecTimeReceived contains a timestamp that is from the same
timer.<br /><br />If you are running under the debugger and stop the process, the clock might not
advance the full wall clock time that has elapsed between calls. If the process is not blocked from
normal operation, the timestamp values will track wall clock time, even if you don't call the
function frequently.<br /><br />The value is only meaningful for this run of the process. Don't
compare it to values obtained on another computer, or other runs of the same process.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="SetDebugOutputFunction"></a>SetDebugOutputFunction</h2>
<div class="bb_code cpp">
    void SetDebugOutputFunction( ESteamNetworkingSocketsDebugOutputType eDetailLevel,
    FSteamNetworkingSocketsDebugOutput pfnFunc );
</div>
<br />Set a function to receive network-related information that is useful for debugging.<br /><br />This
can be extremely useful during development, but it can also be useful for troubleshooting problems
with tech savvy end users. If you have a console or other log that customers can examine, these log
messages can often be helpful to troubleshoot network issues.(Especially any warning/error
messages.)<br /><br />The detail level indicates what message to invoke your callback on. Lower
numeric value means more important, and the value you pass is the lowest priority (highest numeric
value) you wish to receive callbacks for. Except when debugging, you should only use
k_ESteamNetworkingSocketsDebugOutputType_Msg or k_ESteamNetworkingSocketsDebugOutputType_Warning.
For best performance, do NOT request a high detail level and then filter out messages in your
callback. Instead, call this function to adjust the desired level of detail.<br /><br /><strong
    >IMPORTANT</strong
>: This may be called from a service thread, while we own a mutex, etc.
<i>Your callback function must be threadsafe and fast!</i> Do not make any other<br />Steamworks
calls from within the handler.<br />
