<h1>Steam Deck and Proton</h1>
Proton is the compatibility layer that allows Windows games to run on Linux by using a modified
version of Wine and a collection of high-performance graphics API implementations. The team has been
working on and improving Proton for a while now, and it has a large amount of coverage. Most APIs
are already supported by Proton, and most games work out of the box. We're continuing to improve
Proton compatibility, and our goal is to get as close to full coverage as possible. <br />
<br />
To test your gameâ€™s Proton compatibility, you will need a Linux environment. You can install Linux
and Steam on a machine to test, or request a developer kit once they are available (limited
quantities). Once you are set up in your Linux environment / developer kit, you will be able to use
the provided debugging tools to run game builds through a remote debugger and profile performance.
Access to the tools is still a work-in-progress and this page will be updated with more information
in the coming days.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Proton Anti-Cheat Support</h2>
Proton supports some common anti-cheat middleware, including Easy Anti-Cheat and BattlEye.<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        <h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="2"></a>Easy Anti-Cheat</h2>
        Proton supports Easy Anti-Cheat without requiring any recompilation, but it does require you
        to manually enable support for your build. For the Epic Online Services version of EAC, see
        instructions

            rel="noreferrer"
            >here</a
        >. For the Kamu version of EAC, follow these steps in order:<br />
        <ol class="bb_ol">
            <li>
                Go into the SDK Configuration settings menu on the EAC partner site and enable Linux
                as a client platform.<br />
            </li>
            <li>
                Go into the Client Module Releases menu on the EAC partner site, choose the Unix
                platform, and activate a module. If you cannot find the Linux module in the status
                dashboards, please contact EAC support.<br />
            </li>
            <li>
                Once that's done, download the EAC SDK and find the Linux library
                (<i>\Client\Assets\Plugins\x86_64\libeasyanticheat.so</i>) for the SDK version
                integrated with your game, rename it to <i>easyanticheat_x64.so</i>, and add it to
                your depot next to the Windows library (<i>EasyAntiCheat_x64.dll</i>).<br />
            </li>
            <li>
                Lastly, on the Steamworks site, publish a new build of your game containing the new
                depot contents. (You don't have to make any changes to the game executable, just
                include the new files in the depot contents.)
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="3"></a>BattlEye</h2>
        Proton supports BattlEye and BattlEye-enabled games. Each title requires a manual
        configuration step, so please email your Valve or BattlEye technical contact for details.
    </li>
</ul>
<br />
If your title's functionality was previously blocked or limited by anti-cheat, but you've since
completed the above steps to enable Proton/Steam Deck support, you can resubmit your game for a
follow-up review. Please see the
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/steamdeck/compat" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
    >Steam Deck Compatibility Review documentation</a

for more details.<br />

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="4"></a>Known Proton Issues</h2>
Below are a few recommendations around areas that have been known to be Proton compatibility issues
and likely to induce delays in Proton fully supporting a given title after it launches on Steam:<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        .NET / WPF: Our recommendation is to use standalone technologies like Qt for launchers
        instead of OS-dependent frameworks like .NET / WPF. For best results, skip separate
        launchers altogether and integrate their functionality into the game client UI instead,
        where controller support is likely better.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Media Foundation: To save additional bandwidth and disk use, we recommend using standalone
        codecs like VP9 or AV1.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Anti-cheat: We recommend using user-space anti-cheat components for best results, as they
        can typically run in the Wine environment and provide the same level of functionality.
        Kernel-space solutions are not currently supported and are not recommended. Note: we have
        been working with most anti-cheat technology providers to provide Proton compatibility. If
        your solution currently isn't working, please reach out to both your vendor and Valve for
        support.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Anti-tamper / DRM: In general we don't recommend use of such solutions across any PC
        platforms, as they may impact disk usage and overall performance. Getting them fully
        functional in the Wine environment can take some time and add significant latency to getting
        your title supported.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="5"></a>Reporting Issues</h2>
