<h1>How to load and run games on Steam Deck</h1>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Overview</h2>
To help developers work with Steam Deck, we are providing the
<strong>SteamOS Devkit Client Tool</strong> and the <strong>SteamOS Devkit Service</strong>. These
tools allow you to load game builds directly from your development machine to your Steam Deck
Dev-kit (or Linux machine), as well as perform other development activities.
<div class="bb_callout">
    <div>
        <strong>Important: </strong><br />
        Before uploading and testing your own title using the instructions below, we recommend
        installing and running another title from Steam that uses Steam Play(Proton) on the Steam
        Deck dev-kit. This will ensure Proton and its dependencies are installed.
    </div>
</div>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="2"></a>Install Tools</h2>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="3"></a>Client Setup (Dev PC side)</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        The <strong>SteamOS Devkit Client</strong> runs on your development PC and allows developers
        to connect to a Steam Deck or Linux system to deploy / debug software. <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Install SteamOS Devkit Client from Steam - here is a
        <a href="steam://install/943760">direct install link</a>.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        The tool can be started from the Steam Library, in the Software category. If you prefer to
        run it from the command line:<br />
        <ul>
            <li>
                On Windows, run
                <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">windows-client/devkit-gui.exe</code
                ><br />
            </li>
            <li>
                On Linux, run
                <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight"
                    >python3.9 ./devkit-gui-cp39.pyz</code
                >
                in the
                <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">linux-client</code> directory
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="4"></a>Server Setup (Steam Deck side)</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        The <strong>SteamOS Devkit Service</strong> runs on the target Steam Deck / Linux system,
        and allows developers to connect from another PC and deploy / debug their software.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        If you have a Steam Deck dev-kit, the SteamOS Devkit Service is pre-installed and running -
        no further action is needed.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        If you do not have a Steam Deck and are testing from your own Linux system, you will need to
        install the SteamOS Devkit Service. Here is a
        <a href="steam://install/935870">direct install link</a> to the Devkit Service tool. (This
        service is only supported on a PC running Manjaro as per the instructions
        <a href="/doc/steamdeck/testing">here</a>)
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="5"></a>Connecting to Deck</h2>
On your Dev PC, launch the SteamOS Dev-kit Client. The dev-kit / Linux system needs to be on a local
area network allowing Multicast DNS with the development host in order to be discovered and listed.
This works over Wi-Fi or ethernet (via a USB-C hub).<br />
<br />
<ul>
    <li>
        Make sure your Steam Deck is connected to the network, and all updates have been applied
        (<strong>Settings &gt; System</strong>)<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>On your Steam Deck</strong>: Go to Settings &gt; System, and select
        <strong>Enable Developer Mode</strong> under the System Settings section. Then in Settings
        &gt; Developer, select <strong>Pair new host </strong>under the Development Kit section<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>On your Dev PC:</strong> In the Devkit tool, look for your Linux system (EV2 devkits
        will show up as callistoXXX, the newer DV units as 'Valve Aerith'). Click the
        <strong>Register</strong> button to the right to register this devkit with the tool. (This
        sets up a ssh key on the device and grants full control.)<br />
    </li>
    <li><strong>On your Steam Deck</strong>: Approve the pairing request from your PC.<br /></li>
    <li>
        If you don't see anything in the dev-kit tool UI, check to make sure your dev pc and dev-kit
        are on the same LAN. Depending on your environment, you may have to use the
        <strong>Add by IP</strong> field.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="6"></a>Uploading a game build to Steam Deck</h2>
Click the <strong>Title Upload</strong> tab to configure a game for upload from your dev PC to the
Steam Deck dev-kit. The screen looks something like this when filled out:<br />
<br />
<img
    src="https://cdn.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/title-upload-20211111.png"
    alt="title-upload-20211111.png"
    title="title-upload-20211111.png"
/><br />
<br />
This screenshot is an example of uploading a Windows build of a test game to the devkit.<br />
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Local Folder</strong> - The base directory that contains all the files necessary for
        your game to run.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Upload filtering</strong> - The upload process uses rsync over ssh, and is meant to
        be fast for repeated uploads with few content changes.<br />
        <br />
        There are three options to control what gets uploaded:<br />
        <br />
        <strong>Exclude only</strong> takes a space separated list of patterns to exclude from the
        upload.<br />
        <strong>Include only</strong> will only upload files and directories matching the patterns,
        ignoring everything else.<br />
        <strong>Rsync args</strong> allows advanced users to specify rsync command line arguments
        directly.<br />
        <br />
        For more details on the filtering patterns, see
        <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/rsync" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
            >exclude patterns</a
        >.<br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Clean upload</strong> - Enable this to delete any files on the devkit that are not
        present in the <strong>Local Folder</strong> once the exclude patterns are applied.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Start Command</strong> - Set this to game's binary executable (and any arguments you
        want to add).<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Steam Play</strong> - Check this if you are uploading Windows binaries that need to
        be executed over Steam Play using Proton.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Steam Play debug</strong> - The debugger service checkbox allows you to step through
        your C++ build in Visual Studio.
    </li>
</ul>
<br />
If you have an appid for your game already and are using the Steamworks API, you'll want to include
the <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">steam_appid.txt</code> file (which should just
contain your appid) at the top root folder of your upload, as well as next to your executable. You
can read more about that in the
<a href="/doc/sdk/api#initialization_and_shutdown">Steamworks API Initialization and Shutdown</a>
article.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="7"></a>Running uploaded game builds</h2>
On your Steam Deck devkit, navigate the library to find a new title named 'Devkit Game:
YourGameName' and select it to run.
<div class="bb_callout">
    <div>
        As mentioned at the top of the article, before uploading and testing your own title
        directly, we recommend installing another title from Steam that uses Steam Play (Proton) on
        the Steam Deck devkit and running it first. This will ensure Proton and all its dependencies
        are properly installed.
    </div>
</div>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="client_console"></a>Steam Client Console</h2>
If your development requires you to run Steam client console commands, these are available through
the <strong>CEF Console</strong>. <br />
<br />
With your Devkit client tool running and connected to your Deck, on the
<strong>Devkits</strong> tab, click the <strong>CEF Console</strong> button. This should open a
browser tab which connects to the CEF client on your Steam Deck device. On that page, click
<strong>SP</strong> to open a tab specific to the main Steam Deck client UI. This will include a CEF
debug console on the right side of the page.<br />
<br />
Once the CEF debug window opens, in the Console tab, enable Steam Console output by running the
command <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">EnableSteamConsole()</code>. After running
this command, output normally shown in the Steam client <strong>Console</strong> tab (when launched
with <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">-console</code>) will show up here highlighted
as <strong>SteamClient</strong>.<br />
<br />
To execute console commands, wrap the entire command in double quotes in a call to
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">SteamClient.Console.ExecCommand()</code>. The
example below shows two such calls, one to enable testing Dynamic Cloud Sync for app 480, and the
subsequent one to disable it:<br />
