<h1>How to debug Windows games on Steam Deck</h1>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Overview</h2>
Follow the instructions below to learn how you can debug your game's Windows binaries (running via
Proton) on a Steam Deck developer kit. You'll need to bundle the Windows debug runtime with your
game when you upload it to your developer kit, and Visual Studio &amp; remote debugging tools
running on your Windows development box.

        NOTE: The remote debugging features are only supported against the Proton - Experimental
        release

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="2"></a>Setup</h2>
Be sure to see <a href="/doc/steamdeck/loadgames">How to load and run games on Steam Deck</a> to
upload and run your game on your developer kit. Make sure to bundle the Windows debug runtime
(details below).
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="3"></a>Bundling the Windows debug runtime:</h2>
The Windows debug runtime is not distributed with Proton. You will need to bundle the debug runtime
DLLs with your build. See
<a
    href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/preparing-a-test-machine-to-run-a-debug-executable"
    target="_blank"
    rel="noreferrer"
    >https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/preparing-a-test-machine-to-run-a-debug-executable</a
>
for details. For Visual Studio, a Debug deploy configuration should work. The project properties has
an advanced option to 'Copy c++ Runtime to OutDir' that can be helpful for C++ projects.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="4"></a>Visual Studio remote debugging tools in Proton:</h2>
Visual Studio's remote debugging tools are not distributed with Proton. When you upload a title with
the Steam Play button checked, the devkit tool will copy the remote debugging tools from your
Windows development host to the devkit system.<br />
<br />
Currently the devkit will search for the installed debugging tools from Visual Studio 2019 and
Visual Studio 2017. In order to have the remote debugging tools available, when you install Visual
Studio, be sure to include a development Workload like the "Desktop development with C++"<br />

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="5"></a>Usage</h2>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="6"></a>Vulkan Examples</h2>
The project
<a href="https://gitlab.steamos.cloud/jupiter/vulkan-examples" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
    >Vulkan Examples</a
>
is a good starting point for getting used to remotely debug games uploaded to the Steam Deck
devkit.<br />
<br />
Clone the project and change the current directory:<br />
<div class="bb_code">
    git clone --recursive https://gitlab.steamos.cloud/jupiter/vulkan-examples.git cd
    vulkan-examples
</div>
<br />
The project contains several different small Vulkan samples located in the examples directory. For
documentation purposes we will just use
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">imgui</code>. Generate and build the project:<br />
<div class="bb_code">
    cmake -G "Visual Studio 16 2019" -S . -Bbuild/windows cmake --build build/windows --config Debug
    --target imgui
</div>
<br />
Note: the Cmake build downloads additional assets by running a small script, you will need Python on
your build host.<br />
<br />
This will create a
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">build/windows/bin/Debug</code> directory that
contains the <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">imgui</code> executable, the required
Windows debug DLLs and the data assets.<br />
<br />
At this point you can upload the resulting Debug directory.<br />
<br />
Be sure to select "This title requires Steam Play", because this is not a Linux native build, and
also select "Start Visual Studio C++ debugger service on launch" to enable a remote debugger.<br />
<br />
If attaching once your game is running is not adequate, and you wish to debug the startup and
initialization of your title, use "Wait for a debug client to attach" and see the "early attach"
section in this document.<br />
<br />

    title="devkit-tool-remote-debug-20211207.png"
/><br />
<br />
Once the transfer completes, if for example you chose the name
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">vulkan_examples_debug</code>, you should find a new
game called
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">Devkit Game: vulkan_examples_debug</code> in the
Steam game library.<br />
<br />
By launching the game a msvsmon server for remote debugging will automatically start too.<br />
<br />

    title="Screenshot_from_2021-07-14_10-05-21.png"
/><br />
<br />
Finally you are now able to attach a debugger to the running game.<br />
<br />
In Visual Studio press <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">Ctrl+Alt+P</code> to open
the <i>Debug &gt; Attach to Process</i>. In Connection target set the IP and port of the msvsmon
server, and then select the
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">imgui.exe</code> process.<br />
<br />

<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="7"></a>Unreal Engine 4 examples</h2>
Create an Epic Games account, if you don't have one already, and then
<a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/get-now" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">download</a>
and install the Unreal Engine 4.<br />
<br />
As an example we are going to use one of the sample projects that the Unreal Editor offers. Create a
new project and choose the "Puzzle" template<br />
<br />

    title="Screenshot_2021-07-16_072803.png"
/><br />
<br />
Select a project name and a location<br />
<br />

    title="Screenshot_2021-07-15_082533.png"
/><br />
<br />
Go to Edit-&gt;Project settings-&gt;Packaging and choose either "Debug" or "DebugGame" as the build
configuration. You can find more information in the
<a
    href="https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.26/en-US/ProductionPipelines/DevelopmentSetup/BuildConfigurations"
    target="_blank"
    rel="noreferrer"
    >official documentation</a
>. If you tick "Include Debug Files", the debug files will be included in the packaged game.<br />
<br />

    title="Screenshot_2021-07-16_073647.png"
/><br />
<br />
If you are not able to compile a native Linux build, e.g. if your game has external dependencies
that don't support Linux, you can start a Windows build by using File-&gt;Package
Project-&gt;Windows (64-bit). This will create a build in a new directory called
"WindowsNoEditor".<br />
<br />
Upload your compiled game using the
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">SteamOS Devkit Client</code>.<br />
<br />
<img
    src="https://cdn.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/Screenshot_2021-07-16_074524.png"

    title="Screenshot_2021-07-16_074524.png"
/><br />
<br />
In the Steam library you should have a new entry with a name similar to
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">Devkit Game: puzzle</code>. By launching the game a
msvsmon server for remote debugging will automatically start too.<br />
<br />
As the last step you can now attach a debugger to the running game.<br />
<br />
In Visual Studio press <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">Ctrl+Alt+P</code> to open
the <i>Debug &gt; Attach to Process</i>. In Connection target set the IP and port of the msvsmon
server, and then select the
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">puzzle.exe</code> process.<br />
<br />
For a detailed step-by-step guide you can follow the
<a
    href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/debugger/attach-to-running-processes-with-the-visual-studio-debugger"

    >Microsoft debugging documentation</a
>.
<h2 class="bb_subsection">
    <a name="8"></a>Remote debugging process startup: "early attach" support:
</h2>
<br />
The remote debug service can be configured to wait for the user to attach before launching the
title. This allows you to set a breakpoint in WinMain or other initialization code.<br />
<br />
This requires that you first install a Microsoft extension in Visual Studio on your development
host:
<a
    href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vsdbgplat.MicrosoftChildProcessDebuggingPowerTool"
    target="_blank"
    rel="noreferrer"
    >https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vsdbgplat.MicrosoftChildProcessDebuggingPowerTool</a
><br />
<br />
<img
    src="https://cdn.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/child-process-debug-extension.png"
    alt="child-process-debug-extension.png"
    title="child-process-debug-extension.png"
/><br />
<br />
Once the extension is installed, enable child process debugging per the documentation (Debug &gt;
Other Debug Targets &gt; Child Process Debugging Settings)<br />
<br />
Check "Wait for a debug client to attach" in your devkit tool, and upload your title.<br />
<br />
Launch your title normally.<br />
<br />
When attaching to the remote process, attach to
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">steam.exe</code> - once you attach, Proton will
immediately launch your title as a child process, the extension will kick in and start debugging
your title from its startup with your breakpoints activated.<br />
