<h1>Steam Deck Verified Landing Pages</h1>
Steam automatically creates a special landing page for any game that is marked as Steam Deck
Verified.<br />
<br />
This page displays the first trailer available on the game's store page, based on any language or
country restrictions set for the trailers.<br />
