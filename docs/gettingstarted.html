<h1>Getting Started</h1>
The purpose of this documentation is to provide you with the information and resources you'll need
to release your products on
<a href="http://store.steampowered.com/about/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Steam</a>, one of
the leading entertainment platforms worldwide.<br />
<br />
In this section, you'll find information about becoming a Steamworks partner. Steamworks is a set of
tools that enable you to distribute your product to Steam customers and a set of features you can
use in your product, such as matchmaking, leaderboards, Steam Workshop, etc. The Steamworks partner
portal is where you'll be able to manage each of your products, and your account and company
information.<br />

        <h4>Create your Steam build &amp; depots</h4>
        To get your application up and running on Steam, you'll need to upload a build and configure
        a few settings. This process is outlined in detail in
        <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/sdk/uploading" class="bb_doclink"
            >Uploading to Steam</a
        >. When you want to build and test your application is up to you.<br />
        <br />
    </li>

        <h4>Configure Steamworks features</h4>
        You are free to use as few or as many of Steamworks features as you like. For more
        information, see

        <h4>Creating your store page &amp; pricing</h4>
        While you're working on getting your application up and running, you can also be preparing
        the store presence for your game or software. If you have any questions during the process,
        you can ask questions or search for help in the Store Page/Marketing forums. For more
        information see

    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Preparing for Release</h4>
        Most of the work to prepare your product for release on Steam can be done yourself through
        the tools and documentation. But once you get close to releasing, Valve will need to review
        your store page, proposed pricing, and game build.<br />
