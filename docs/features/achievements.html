<h1>Stats and Achievements</h1>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Overview</h2>
Steam Stats and Achievements provides an easy way for your game to provide persistent, roaming
achievement and statistics tracking for your users. The user's data is associated with their Steam
account, and each user's achievements and statistics can be formatted and displayed in their Steam
Community Profile.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="2"></a>What they are good for</h2>
In addition to providing highly-valued rewards to players of your games, achievements are useful for
encouraging and rewarding teamwork and player interaction, providing extra dimensionality to the
game objectives, and rewarding users for spending more of their time in-game.<br />
<br />
Statistics track fine-grained pieces of information, such as playtime, number of power-ups used,
etc. You may choose to use them simply for tracking internal game data - so that, for instance, you
can grant an achievement based on multi-session game play statistics collected from the user across
multiple computers.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="3"></a>Implementation Overview</h2>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="4"></a>Define Your Game's Stats and Achievements</h2>
Achievements are application specific and are setup on the App Admin page of the Steamworks partner
site.<br />
<br />
There are three types of statistics your game can store:<br />
<ul>
    <li><strong>INT</strong> - A 32-bit (signed) integer (e.g. number of games played)<br /></li>
    <li>
        <strong>FLOAT</strong> - A 32-bit floating point value (e.g. number of miles driven)<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>AVGRATE</strong> - A moving average. See:
        <a href="#AVGRATE">The AVGRATE stat type</a>
    </li>
</ul>
<br />
The Steamworks Partner Website provides an interface for defining and updating your game's
statistics and achievements. Using it, you can:<br />
<ul>
    <li>Define the initial statistics and achievements<br /></li>
    <li>Add additional stats and achievements<br /></li>
    <li>Update achievement names, descriptions, and icons<br /></li>
    <li>
        Update statistic parameters and constraints (max/min values, moving-average window sizes,
        etc)
    </li>
</ul>
Stats have the following properties:<br />
<ul>
    <li><strong>ID</strong> - An automatically-generated numerical ID for each stat.<br /></li>
    <li>
        <strong>Type</strong> - The type of this Stat - INT, FLOAT, or
        <a href="#AVGRATE">AVGRATE</a>.<br />
    </li>
    <li><strong>API Name</strong> - The string used to access this stat using the API.<br /></li>
    <li>
        <strong>Set By</strong> - Sets who can modify the stat. The default is Client. For more see
        <a href="#game_server_stats">Game Server Stats</a>.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Increment Only</strong> - If set, this stat is only allowed to increase in value
        over time.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Max Change</strong> - If set, sets a limit on the amount that the stat's value can
        change from one SetStat call to the next.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Min Value</strong> - If set, the minimum numerical value this stat may take. By
        default, the min is the minimum of the underlying numerical type (INT_MIN or -FLT_MAX).<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Max Value</strong> - If set, the maximum numerical value this stat may take. By
        default, the max is the maximum of the underlying numerical type (INT_MAX or FLT_MAX).<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Default Value</strong> - If set, the default value that this stat will initially be
        set to for a new user. If not set, the default value is zero.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Aggregated -</strong> If set, Steam will keep a global total for this stat. See
        Global Stats below for more information.<br />
    </li>
    <li><strong>Display Name</strong> - The name of this stat, when displayed in your app.</li>
</ul>
<strong>AVGRATE</strong> stats have the following additional properties:<br />
<ul>
    <li>Window - The size of the "sliding window" used to average your data.</li>
</ul>
An <strong>AVGRATE</strong> stat is one that is automatically averaged by Steam. See the
<a href="#AVGRATE">AVGRATE</a> section below for more information.<br />
<br />
Achievements have the following properties:<br />
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>ID</strong> - An automatically-generated numerical ID for each achievement.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>API Name</strong> - The string used to access this achievement using the API.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Progress Stat</strong> - Specifies a stat that's used as a progress bar in the
        Community for this achievement. The achievement will also automatically unlock when the stat
        reaches the unlock value.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Display Name</strong> - The name this achievement will have in client notification
        pop-ups, and in the Community. May be localized.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Description</strong> - A description of this achievement, for displaying in the
        Community. May be localized.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Set By</strong> - Sets who can unlock the achievement. The default is client. For
        more see <a href="#game_server_stats">Game Server Stats</a>.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Hidden?</strong> - If true, a "hidden" achievement does not show up on a user's
        Community page (at all) until they have achieved it.<br />
    </li>
    <li><strong>Achieved Icon</strong> - The icon to display when it is achieved.<br /></li>
    <li><strong>Unachieved Icon</strong> - The icon to display when it is not yet achieved.</li>
</ul>
<br />
The following is the list of achievements from the
<a href="/doc/sdk/api/example">Steamworks API Example Application (SpaceWar)</a>:<br />

<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="5"></a>Special Considerations</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Achievement names and icons should be all-ages appropriate.<br /></li>
    <li>
        By default, games are limited to 100 achievements at first. Once your app reaches the
        threshold for <a href="/doc/marketing/profile">Profile Features</a>, you will be able to add
        more achievements.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="6"></a>How to use them</h2>
<h4>Accessing Stats and Achievements from within your game:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        After initializing the <a href="/doc/api">Steamworks API</a> you can start to use the Stats
        and Achievements API which is contained within
        <a href="/doc/api/ISteamUserStats">ISteamUserStats</a>.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        At the start of a game session, call
        <a href="/doc/api/ISteamUserStats#RequestCurrentStats"
            >ISteamUserStats::RequestCurrentStats</a
        >
        to fetch the user's stats and achievement data from the Steam back end. You will receive a
        <a href="/doc/api/ISteamUserStats#UserStatsReceived_t"
            >ISteamUserStats::UserStatsReceived_t</a
        >
        callback when the data is ready.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Use <a href="/doc/api/ISteamUserStats#GetStat">ISteamUserStats::GetStat</a> and
        <a href="/doc/api/ISteamUserStats#GetAchievement">ISteamUserStats::GetAchievement</a> to
        iterate the data and initialize game state.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        If you want to display the achievements in your game you can use
        <a href="/doc/api/ISteamUserStats#GetAchievementDisplayAttribute"
            >ISteamUserStats::GetAchievementDisplayAttribute</a
        >
        to retrieve human-readable properties of the achievement, including its name ("name") and
        description ("desc"). These properties are localizable on the Steamworks Partner Website,
        and the returned data varies with the language in which the user is running the game. You
        can also get an achievement's icon using
        <a href="/doc/api/ISteamUserStats#GetAchievementIcon"
            >ISteamUserStats::GetAchievementIcon</a
        >
        or the time each achievements was unlocked with
        <a href="/doc/api/ISteamUserStats#GetAchievementAndUnlockTime"
            >ISteamUserStats::GetAchievementAndUnlockTime</a
        >.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Whenever a stat changes, especially before any changes are shown to the user, call
        <a href="/doc/api/ISteamUserStats#SetStat">ISteamUserStats::SetStat</a> or
        <a href="/doc/api/ISteamUserStats#UpdateAvgRateStat">ISteamUserStats::UpdateAvgRateStat</a>.
        These calls only modify Steam's in-memory state and are very cheap. Doing so allows Steam to
        persist the changes between sessions even in event of game crash.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        At appropriate points within your game (i.e. checkpoints, level transitions), call
        <a href="/doc/api/ISteamUserStats#StoreStats">ISteamUserStats::StoreStats</a> to upload the
        changes. You will receive a
        <a href="/doc/api/ISteamUserStats#UserStatsStored_t">ISteamUserStats::UserStatsStored_t</a>
        callback when that has completed.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        For achievements that have progress bars use
        <a href="/doc/api/ISteamUserStats#IndicateAchievementProgress"
            >ISteamUserStats::IndicateAchievementProgress</a
        >
        at significant points to show a pop-up with the progress. For instance, if you need 20 wins
        you may want to call this at 10 wins to show that the user has made it halfway.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Whenever one or more achievements are unlocked, call
        <a href="/doc/api/ISteamUserStats#SetAchievement">ISteamUserStats::SetAchievement</a> for
        each unlocked achievement and then
        <a href="/doc/api/ISteamUserStats#StoreStats">ISteamUserStats::StoreStats</a> to immediately
        upload them. Your game will see a
        <a href="/doc/api/ISteamUserStats#UserStatsStored_t">ISteamUserStats::UserStatsStored_t</a>
        callback, plus one
        <a href="/doc/api/ISteamUserStats#UserAchievementStored_t"
            >ISteamUserStats::UserAchievementStored_t</a
        >
        callback for each unlocked achievement. The Steam Game Overlay will display a notification
        panel to the user.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="AVGRATE"></a>The AVGRATE stat type</h2>
This type of stat provides some unique and very useful functionality, but it requires a little bit
more detail to explain.<br />
<br />
Consider the case where you'd like to track an average statistic, such as "Points earned per hour".
One approach would be to have two stats, an INT "TotalPoints" and a FLOAT "TotalPlayTimeHours", and
then divide points by time to get Points per Hour.<br />
<br />
The downside to this implementation is that, once the player has accumulated a significant amount of
playtime, the calculated average will change extremely slowly. In fact, the more the user plays the
game, the less responsive that average will be. If the user has spent 100 hours playing the game,
the calculated average will "lag" by about 50 hours of that. If they increase their skill, they will
not see the increase in Points Per Hour that they expect.<br />
<br />
The AVGRATE stat type lets you implement a "sliding window" effect on the average. For instance, you
can utilize only the previous few hours of gameplay, so the statistic will more accurately reflect
the player's current skill level.<br />
<br />
Let's set up an AVGRATE stat to implement "points per hour" where only the previous 20 hours of
gameplay affect the value. To do this, you would:<br />
<ul>
    <li>
        Note that, because the average will be "per hour", the time units on all time parameters
        associated with this stat will be "hours". This applies to the Window property on the stat
        itself, and also for the "dSessionLength" parameter passed in to
        <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">UpdateAvgRateStat</code> below.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Create an AVGRATE stat named "AvgPointsPerHour", and a Window property of 20.0 (remember,
        that's in "hours")<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        At appropriate points during your game, call
        <a href="/doc/api/ISteamUserStats#UpdateAvgRateStat">ISteamUserStats::UpdateAvgRateStat</a>
        with the following parameters:<br />
        <ul>
            <li><strong>pchName</strong> - "AvgPointsPerHour"<br /></li>
            <li>
                <strong>flCountThisSession</strong> - The number of points the player earned since
                the last call to UpdateAvgRateStat.<br />
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>dSessionLength</strong> - The amount of game time since the last call to
                UpdateAvgRateStat. The unit should be the same as the unit on the stat's Window
                property. In this case, it is "hours".<br />
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        For instance, if the player earned 77 points in the last round, which lasted 0.225 hours
        (13.5 minutes), that would be
        <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight"
            >SteamUserStats()-&gt;UpdateAvgRateStat( "AvgPointsPerHour", 77, 0.225 )</code
        >
    </li>
</ul>
In the above example, Steam will take the current rounds average of 342.2 points per hour ( 77
divided by 0.225 ) and blend it with the previous value. The result will reflect the total average
over the player's last 20 hours of game time. If this were the first time the stat was updated for
the current user, the current value would be 342.2.<br />
<br />
This example uses "hours" as the time unit, but you may use whatever time unit you wish. Just keep
in mind that you must consistently use that unit as your base for "dSessionLength", as well as the
Window property.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="7"></a>Getting stats for other users</h2>
You can use
<a href="/doc/api/ISteamUserStats#RequestUserStats">ISteamUserStats::RequestUserStats</a> to get the
stats for another user. You can then use
<a href="/doc/api/ISteamUserStats#GetUserStat">ISteamUserStats::GetUserStat</a>,
<a href="/doc/api/ISteamUserStats#GetUserAchievement">ISteamUserStats::GetUserAchievement</a>, and
<a href="/doc/api/ISteamUserStats#GetUserAchievementAndUnlockTime"
    >ISteamUserStats::GetUserAchievementAndUnlockTime</a
>
to get data for that user. This data is not updated automatically as the other user uploads new
stats, so to refresh the data just call
<a href="/doc/api/ISteamUserStats#RequestUserStats">ISteamUserStats::RequestUserStats</a>
again.<br />
<br />
To keep from using too much memory, a Least Recently Used (LRU) cache is maintained and other user's
stats will occasionally be unloaded. When this happens a
<a href="/doc/api/ISteamUserStats#UserStatsUnloaded_t">ISteamUserStats::UserStatsUnloaded_t</a>
callback is automatically sent. When this callback is sent then the specified user's stats will be
unavailable until
<a href="/doc/api/ISteamUserStats#RequestUserStats">ISteamUserStats::RequestUserStats</a> is called
again.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="8"></a>Offline mode</h2>
Steam keeps a local cache of the stats and achievement data so that the APIs can be used as normal
in offline mode. Any stats unable to be committed are saved for the next time the user is online. In
the event that there have been modifications on more than one machine, Steam will automatically
merge achievements and choose the set of stats that has had more progress. Because Steam keeps a
local cache of stats data it is not necessary for the game to also keep a local cache of the data on
disk. Such caches often come in conflict, and when they do it looks to users as if their progress
has been reverted, which is a frustrating experience.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="game_server_stats"></a>Game Server Stats</h2>
Parallel to <a href="/doc/api/ISteamUserStats">ISteamUserStats</a> is
<a href="/doc/api/ISteamGameServerStats">ISteamGameServerStats</a> for game servers. These can get
stats for users in the same way as clients can (described above). They can also set stats and award
achievements, but only if "Set by" is set to GS (game server) or Official GS. The difference between
game servers and official game servers is that official game servers are servers that you host and
control. Using official game servers to set stats offers enhanced security against cheating, as
users may be able to modify their own game servers or spoof being a game server. To define official
game servers, enter the IP ranges of the servers
<a href="/apps/dedicatedservers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a>.<br />
<br />
Stats and achievements that are settable by game servers cannot be set by clients. Game servers can
only set stats and achievements for users currently playing on the server. If the user leaves the
server there is a short grace period to set any final stats, but then any new uploads will be
denied. This is to help ensure consistency and to avoid making it possible for a malicious game
server to set anyone's stats at any time. Given the restriction, it is important not to wait until
the end of a round to set stats. Set them continuously so you can store them as a user quits.<br />
<br />
Clients will get automatic updates when a game server changes their stats. However, like clients,
stats loaded by the server for other users are not refreshed automatically and can age out.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="9"></a>Resetting stats</h2>
During development, it is often the case that a complete wipe of stats and achievements on an
account or all accounts is desirable for testing. To wipe stats for an account, call
<a href="/doc/api/ISteamUserStats#ResetAllStats">ISteamUserStats::ResetAllStats</a> with
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">bAchievementsToo</code> set to
<strong>true</strong> to wipe achievements as well. Once called remember to reiterate your stats and
achievements and reset your in-memory game state. There is no way to globally wipe stats and
achievements for all users. One of the reasons for this is that even if a global wipe were to be
done, games in-progress may not notice the wipe and write back in-memory values. Fortunately, there
is an easy way to build a global wipe system into your game. To do so:<br />
<ul>
    <li>Define a stat with a name like "Version"<br /></li>
    <li>Put a hardcoded stats version number in the game<br /></li>
    <li>
        Once stats have been loaded, compare the "Version" stat against your hardcoded version
        number<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        If they don't match, call
        <a href="/doc/api/ISteamUserStats#ResetAllStats">ISteamUserStats::ResetAllStats</a> and then
        set the "Version" stat to the hardcoded number.
    </li>
</ul>
This way, whenever you want a global wipe just change the hardcoded stats version number. The global
wipe will then happen as people get the new build.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="10"></a>Stat consistency</h2>
It's a best practice to think about how related stats could become inconsistent. For instance, you
may have three stats "GamesWon", "GamesLost", and "GamesPlayed". Despite the best of intentions,
stats can and do get out of sync with each other. In this case, that could lead to games won and
lost not adding up to the total of games played. If this was resolved by removing the "GamesLost"
stat and instead computing it as "GamesPlayed" - "GamesWon", an inconsistency could cause
"GamesLost" to be negative. In this case, it's best to drop the "GamesPlayed" stat and compute it as
"GamesWon" + "GamesLost".
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="global_stats"></a>Global Stats</h2>
Stats can be marked as aggregated on the admin page to tell Steam to keep a global total of all
users' values for the stat. This can be used to get data on total money in the economy, total kills,
favorite weapons, favorite maps, and which team tends to do better. On the flip side, this should
not be used for stats like "MostKills" as adding that up for multiple users would be meaningless. As
stats are in the hands of users, this data is subject to being manipulated. Therefore it's crucial
when using aggregated stats to set good bounds for min value, max value, increment only (if
appropriate), and max change. Max change has a special meaning for aggregated stats. When a new
value is uploaded, the global value will change no more than the max change value. This limits how
quickly a cheater can influence the global totals.<br />
<br />
To access the global totals, call
<a href="/doc/api/ISteamUserStats#RequestGlobalStats">ISteamUserStats::RequestGlobalStats</a> and
then <a href="/doc/api/ISteamUserStats#GetGlobalStat">ISteamUserStats::GetGlobalStat</a> for each
global stat. You can also ask for
<a href="/doc/api/ISteamUserStats#RequestGlobalStats">ISteamUserStats::RequestGlobalStats</a> for a
specified number of days of history. The history is the amount that stat changed every day. You can
access that history with
<a href="/doc/api/ISteamUserStats#GetGlobalStatHistory">ISteamUserStats::GetGlobalStatHistory</a
>.<br />
<br />
You can also request global achievement completion percentages from the client. To do so first call
<a href="/doc/api/ISteamUserStats#RequestGlobalAchievementPercentages"
    >ISteamUserStats::RequestGlobalAchievementPercentages</a
>. Then, iterate the achievements in order of most completed to least completed by calling
<a href="/doc/api/ISteamUserStats#GetMostAchievedAchievementInfo"
    >ISteamUserStats::GetMostAchievedAchievementInfo</a
>
and
<a href="/doc/api/ISteamUserStats#GetNextMostAchievedAchievementInfo"
    >ISteamUserStats::GetNextMostAchievedAchievementInfo</a
>. You can also get the completion percentage for a particular achievement by calling
<a href="/doc/api/ISteamUserStats#GetAchievementAchievedPercent"
    >ISteamUserStats::GetAchievementAchievedPercent</a
>.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="testing"></a>Testing</h2>
<br />
Before your app is released, you will not be able to see which achievements have been earned in the
Steam Community or library. Your app will need a way to output what achievements have been earned
for the user.<br />
<br />
To clear an achievement or stats without adding code to your game, you can use the Steam client
console. Run with steam.exe -console, then:<br />
<ul>
    <li>achievement_clear &lt;appid&gt; &lt;achievement name&gt;<br /></li>
    <li>reset_all_stats &lt;appid&gt;</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="11"></a>The Steam Community</h2>
After your game has been released then information about individual and global achievement progress
will be displayed in the Steam Community. Each player will have a link from their Community profile
that goes to a page showcasing what they have achieved, and which they have yet to unlock.
<div class="bb_callout">
    <div>
        <strong>NOTE:</strong> Your achievements will not be shown until your app is somewhat
        visible to the community.
    </div>
</div>
<br />
Each achievement is listed with the appropriate icon, and the name and description as set in the
Steamworks control panel. If the achievement name and description have been localized into the
language the user has selected, then they will display in that language.<br />
<br />
There will also be a link from this page, and one from your game's main Steam page, to a set of
global achievement statistics for your game. It displays the percentage of Steam players of the game
that have achieved each one, ordered from most common to the rarest achievement. This is fun for
players to see, and also a great resource for you as a developer: are your special challenges hard
enough? Or maybe too hard? (this information is also available on the Sales and Activations Reports
site).
