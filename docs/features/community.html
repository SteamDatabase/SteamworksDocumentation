friends. There are many features that your team can utilize to make it easier for these players to
enjoy your community, while simultaneously promoting your product.<br />
<br />

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Community Hubs</h2>
Every product on Steam has it's own unique hub. By default, your community hub will be set live as
soon as your product's release state is set to 'Coming Soon'.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="2"></a>Community Tabs</h2>
Community hubs are organized into different tabs based on the type of content they contain.<br />
<br />
By default, these tabs will show the most popular content posted over the previous week. <br />
<br />
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>All</strong> - The front page of your hub. It will showcase a variety of different
        content types to keep things interesting. There are two exceptions to this: recent official
        announcements are pinned to the top of the hub and news posts are added based on date.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Discussions</strong> - All of your product's forums live here. Players create topics
        and reply to each-other based on how you've set it all up. <br />

            >Setting up your Discussions</a
        >.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Screenshots</strong> - By using Steam's integrated screenshot feature, players can
        share their favorite in-game moments with the community. <br />

    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Artwork</strong> - Players are free to upload a variety of content here, including
        detailed concept art, elaborate cosplays or even humorous community memes. The only
        requirement is the content has something to do with your product.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Broadcasting</strong> - Your players can broadcast themselves while playing your
        game. You can also host or promote broadcasts of your own to be featured on your
        storefront.<br />

    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Videos</strong> - The video tab simply allows users to link content that they've
        uploaded to their YouTube channels.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Workshop</strong> - Game modifications that your players create will appear here.
        Other players can subscribe to them and automatically receive the content via Steam's

        <strong>News</strong> - This tab contains your custom announcements along with any
        syndicated news about your product. Announcements are a great way to officially communicate
        with your players. If you are ready to post an announcement to your community, check out the
        following article for more information:<br />

<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="3"></a>Social Media Linking</h2>
<br />

<br />
<br />
In addition to being featured on your game's storefront, your community homepage will also feature
all of the online communities that your team is using.<br />
<br />
You can set up these links from your game's Steamworks Storefront Admin under the 'Basic Info' tab
under the 'External Links' section.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="4"></a>Who is using your hub?</h2>
Players find hubs through a variety of channels. The primary method is through the link from your
product page, but players will also find your hub through search results, links from content created
and uploaded by their friends, along with any marketing from your other communities.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="discussions"></a>Steam Discussions</h2>
Your Steam Discussion hub allows your players to to discuss and share feedback about your product.
You can also use this hub as a way of communicating with players.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="5"></a>Customizing your subforums</h2>
<br />
When your community hub goes live, three forums are created by default: <i>General Discussions</i>:
The landing page and primary forum in your discussion hub; <i>Trading</i>: A dedicated forum where
players can post trade offers and requests without spamming your main forum; <i>Reported Posts</i>:
A hidden forum where your moderators and developers can review content reported by your
community.<br />
<br />
Once you've had a chance to monitor some of the discussions that are happening in your hub, you'll
have a good idea of any customization requirements. You can add or remove sub-forums or customize
existing ones with the following options: <br />
<ul>
    <li>Name - The name of the subforum<br /></li>
    <li>Visibility - Controls who can view each subforum and the content in it.<br /></li>
    <li>Post rights - Who is able to post in existing threads and create new ones.</li>
</ul>
<br />
<strong>Note</strong>: An account must have 'Edit App Metadata' privileges for the app in question
in order to edit this section.<br />
<br />
It's also a good idea to browse other product hubs to get an idea of what customization options you
might want to take advantage of. Some more commonly created options include specific forums for bug
reports, players looking for friends to play with, or even language specific forums.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="6"></a>Moderating your community</h2>
Valve moderation staff will automatically review and resolve all content in your hub that is
reported by other users. Beyond this however, you'll want to keep a close eye on your hub. This
allows you to get feedback on your product, curate specific content and have positive interactions
with your community. <br />
<br />
Accounts that have the Steamworks permission "Edit App Marketing Data" for a given game will display
the Steam persona name followed by "developer" in the Community Hub for that game, so the account
can be recognized by users. You can also moderate the discussions by locking threads, deleting
threads, and banning users, etc.<br />
<br />
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Setup your permissions</strong><br />
        The first thing you'll want to do is check the permission settings for your group. These
        settings control the features that your different group member types are able to use. You
        can access these permissions from the Hub Admin panel by selecting
        <i>Edit Group Permissions</i> <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Adding moderators</strong><br />
        Once you have a good idea of what features are accessible by which member types, you'll want
        to promote other members of your team. You can access this tool from the
        <i>Manage Group Members</i> tool in the admin panel.<br />

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="7"></a>FAQ</h2>
<strong>Q: When does my community hub go live?</strong><br />
A: As soon as your app release state is set to 'Coming Soon'.<br />
<br />
<strong>Q: When can users begin to post content in my hub?</strong><br />
A: This depends on the type of content:<br />
<ul>
    <li>
        Artwork, Guides, Discussions, &amp; Videos can all be uploaded as soon as your release state
        is set to 'Coming Soon'.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Broadcasts and Screenshots require that your product can actually be played. If you've
        distributed
        <a href="/doc/features/keys" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Release Override Keys</a>,
        those players will be able to upload content from their experience.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Workshop items can only be uploaded after you've integrated the Steam Workshop with your
        product. You can find more information on that process
        <a href="/doc/features/workshop" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a>.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Syndicated news will begin to appear in your news feed as soon as the release state is set
        to 'Coming Soon'. You can post your own announcements at any time.
    </li>
</ul>
<br />
<strong>Q: Can I upload content to my own hub?</strong><br />
A: Yes! If your hub is feeling barren, you can upload things like concept art, guides or anything
else that you think the community would appreciate. You should also be considering the use of
<a href="/doc/marketing/event_tools" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Announcements</a> in the Steam
Events tool and <a href="/doc/store/broadcast" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Broadcasts</a> to
really help generate interest in your product.<br />
<br />
<strong
    >Q: Someone from the community offered to help moderate my hub - should I appoint them?</strong
><br />
A: You'll want to make sure that your team is comfortable with this player representing your product
and community. A good way to measure this is by reviewing their contributions to your community as a
player. If they have a history of being helpful, informative, and polite, they'll be much more
likely of having a positive impact on your community. <br />
<br />
You should also review and update the permissions that your moderators have to control the amount of
features they have access to. You can read more about adding moderators
<a href="/doc/marketing/community_moderation/adding_moderators" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
    >here</a
><br />
<br />
<strong
    >Q: Can I use the Steam community to let customers know of non-Steam versions of my game? </strong
><br />
A: In the game you ship via Steam, and in communications on Steam, you may only promote the Steam
version and its availability via Steam, and not other distribution outlets. This applies both to
full versions of your game and to content patches that change the existing version.
