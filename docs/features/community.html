<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Community Hubs</h2>
Every product on Steam has it's own unique hub. By default, your community hub will be set live as
soon as your product's release state is set to 'Coming Soon'.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="2"></a>What's in a hub?</h2>
Community hubs are organized into different tabs based on the type of content they contain.<br /><br />By
default, these tabs will show the most popular content posted over the previous week. <br /><br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        <strong>All</strong> - The front page of your hub. It will showcase a variety of different
        content types to keep things interesting. There are two exceptions to this: recent official
        announcements are pinned to the top of the hub and news posts are added based on date.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Discussions</strong> - All of your product's forums live here. Players create topics
        and reply to each-other based on how you've set it all up. <br /><a

    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Broadcasting</strong> - Your players can broadcast themselves while playing your
        game. You can also host or promote broadcasts of your own to be featured on your

<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="3"></a>Who is using your hub?</h2>
Players find hubs through a variety of channels. The primary method is through the link from your
product page, but players will also find your hub through search results, links from content created
and uploaded by their friends, along with any marketing from your other communities.<br /><br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        <strong>Google Analytics</strong><br />If you want to keep an eye on how players are getting
        to your hub, you can integrate a Google Analytics Tracking ID to gain real-time insight into
        visitor traffic.<br /><br />Detailed setup information is available

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="discussions"></a>Steam Discussions</h2>
Your Steam Discussion hub allows your players to to discuss and share feedback about your product.
You can also use this hub as a way of communicating with players.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="4"></a>Customizing your subforums</h2>
<br />When your community hub goes live, three forums are created by default:
<i>General Discussions</i>: The landing page and primary forum in your discussion hub;
<i>Trading</i>: A dedicated forum where players can post trade offers and requests without spamming
your main forum; <i>Reported Posts</i>: A hidden forum where your moderators and developers can
review content reported by your community.<br /><br />Once you've had a chance to monitor some of
the discussions that are happening in your hub, you'll have a good idea of any customization
requirements. You can add or remove sub-forums or customize existing ones with the following
options: <br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>Name - The name of the subforum<br /></li>
    <li>Visibility - Controls who can view each subforum and the content in it.<br /></li>
    <li>Post rights - Who is able to post in existing threads and create new ones.</li>
</ul>
<br /><strong>Note</strong>: An account must have 'Edit App Metadata' privileges for the app in
question in order to edit this section.<br /><br />It's also a good idea to browse other product
hubs to get an idea of what customization options you might want to take advantage of. Some more
commonly created options include specific forums for bug reports, players looking for friends to
play with, or even language specific forums.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="5"></a>Moderating your community</h2>
Valve moderation staff will automatically review and resolve all content in your hub that is
reported by other users. Beyond this however, you'll want to keep a close eye on your hub. This
allows you to get feedback on your product, curate specific content and have positive interactions
with your community.
<br /><br />As an app admin, your discussion posts will display your Steam name followed by
"developer" so you can be recognized by users. You can also moderate the discussions by locking
threads, deleting threads, and banning users, etc.<br /><br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        <strong>Setup your permissions</strong><br />The first thing you'll want to do is check the
        permission settings for your group. These settings control the features that your different
        group member types are able to use. You can access these permissions from the Hub Admin
        panel by selecting <i>Edit Group Permissions</i> <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Adding moderators</strong><br />Once you have a good idea of what features are
        accessible by which member types, you'll want to promote other members of your team. You can
        access this tool from the <i>Manage Group Members</i> tool in the admin panel.<br /><a

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="6"></a>FAQ</h2>
<strong>Q: When does my community hub go live?</strong><br />As soon as your app release state is
set to 'Coming Soon'.<br /><br /><strong>Q: When can users begin to post content in my hub?</strong
><br />This depends on the type of content:<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        Artwork, Guides, Discussions, &amp; Videos can all be uploaded as soon as your release state
        is set to 'Coming Soon'.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Broadcasts and Screenshots require that your product can actually be played. If you've
        distributed

            >Release Override Keys</a
        >, those players will be able to upload content from their experience.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Workshop items can only be uploaded after you've integrated the Steam Workshop with your

        Syndicated news will begin to appear in your news feed as soon as the release state is set
        to 'Coming Soon'. You can post your own announcements at any time.
    </li>
</ul>
<br /><strong>Q: Can I upload content to my own hub?</strong><br />Yes! If your hub is feeling
barren, you can upload things like concept art, guides or anything else that you think the community
would appreciate. You should also be considering the use of
<a
    href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/marketing/announcements"
    target="_blank"
    rel="noreferrer"
    >Announcements</a
>
and
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/broadcast" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
    >Broadcasts</a
>
to really help generate interest in your product.<br /><br /><strong
    >Q: Someone from the community offered to help moderate my hub - should I appoint them?</strong
><br />You'll want to make sure that your team is comfortable with this player representing your
product and community. A good way to measure this is by reviewing their contributions to your
community as a player. If they have a history of being helpful, informative, and polite, they'll be
much more likely of having a positive impact on your community. <br /><br />You should also review
and update the permissions that your moderators have to control the amount of features they have
access to. You can read more about adding moderators

><br /><br /><strong
    >Q: Can I use the Steam community to let customers know of non-Steam versions of my game? </strong
><br />A: In the game you ship via Steam, and in communications on Steam, you may only promote the
Steam version and its availability via Steam, and not other distribution outlets. This applies both
to full versions of your game and to content patches that change the existing version.
