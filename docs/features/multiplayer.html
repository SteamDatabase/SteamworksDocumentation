<h1>Multiplayer</h1>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Overview</h2>
Steam started as a multiplayer gaming platform with the release of Counter-Strike 1.6 and
multiplayer has always been a huge focus. Steam provides many different features and APIs to improve
the multiplayer experience for developers and customers alike. With these features you can easily
allow players to find and play with each other using the Steam Matchmaking APIs, or use the Steam
Game Servers API to provide persistent dedicated servers that your players can create communities
around.<br />
<br />
To facilitate multiplayer games on Steam, there are many options available and different paths to
take. Before starting you will want to have the following questions answered:
<h4>Does your game already have networking?</h4>
If your game is peer-to-peer then all you need to do is integrate
<a href="#matchmaking" class="bb_doclink">Steam Matchmaking &amp; Lobbies</a> with your networking
to provide a great experience for Steam users.
<h4>Do you want your game to be Peer-to-peer based or server based?</h4>
Depending on the type of game one or the other will likely make your game more enjoyable for
users.<br />
<br />
If your game is highly competitive like an esport then we recommend that you use
<a href="#gameservers" class="bb_doclink">Steam Game Servers</a>.<br />
<br />
If your game has smaller party sizes, you'll likely want to use
<a href="#matchmaking" class="bb_doclink">Steam Matchmaking &amp; Lobbies</a> and
<a href="#networking" class="bb_doclink">Steam Peer-to-peer Networking</a>.
<h4>Do you want voice chat?</h4>
The
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/features/voice" class="bb_doclink">Steam Voice</a> APIs
provide almost everything you need to implement voice chat quick and easily. It does not network the
recorded audio by itself, so you'll still need to send this data to other users using something like
<a href="#networking" class="bb_doclink">Steam Peer-to-peer Networking</a> or
<a href="#gameservers" class="bb_doclink">Steam Game Servers</a>.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="2"></a>What is available?</h2>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="matchmaking"></a>Steam Matchmaking &amp; Lobbies</h2>
This provides the backbone for getting players playing together. The lobby system is most common
when you have players get together before actually starting the game session. Matchmaking and
lobbies do not provide networking features, you'll want to use something like
<a href="#networking" class="bb_doclink">Steam Peer-to-peer Networking</a> or
<a href="#gameservers" class="bb_doclink">Steam Game Servers</a>, or the networking that your engine
provides along side.<br />

<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="networking"></a>Steam Peer-to-peer Networking</h2>
This provides peer-to-peer networking for small groups of players.<br />

<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="gameservers"></a>Steam Game Servers</h2>
The Steam Game Servers API provides everything you need to create dedicated servers for your game.
You can host these game servers yourself, or allow your community to host them for you. This is the
best choice for highly competitive games (such as Dota 2) or games with persistent servers that keep
running even after all players leave (such as Team Fortress 2).<br />
