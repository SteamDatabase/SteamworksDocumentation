<h1>Steam Voice</h1>
The Steam Voice API is a set of functions that allow you record audio from the user's microphone.
This can be used to implement voice chat or a voice command system.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Voice Chat Integration</h2>
Voice chat in your game can be implemented using the following steps:<br /><br />
<ul class="bb_ul ">
    <li>
        <strong>Recording</strong><br />
        First call
        <a
            href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamUser#StartVoiceRecording"
            class="bb_apilink"
            >ISteamUser::StartVoiceRecording</a
        >
        to begin recording the users microphone, this could be called whenever the user is pressing
        a push-to-talk hotkey or at the start of the gameplay session if the microphone should
        always be recording. Depending on your game either may be preferable, but giving players the
        option for both always-on, and push-to-talk is ideal. It's rarely a good idea to default to
        always-on though, and if your game supports more than 4 players then always-on is never
        recommended. Then when the player releases their push-to-talk hotkey, or the gameplay
        session ends you should call
        <a
            href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamUser#StopVoiceRecording"
            class="bb_apilink"
            >ISteamUser::StopVoiceRecording</a
        >
        to stop recording.<br /><br />
        If the user is using push-to-talk voice chat, you can call
        <a
            href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamFriends#SetInGameVoiceSpeaking"
            class="bb_apilink"
            >ISteamFriends::SetInGameVoiceSpeaking</a
        >
        when you start and stop recording to mute any voice chat the user may be doing through the
        Steam friends UI. Ideally you would give players the option to enable/disable this
        functionality.<br /><br />
        After you start recording you should call
        <a
            href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamUser#GetAvailableVoice"
            class="bb_apilink"
            >ISteamUser::GetAvailableVoice</a
        >
        each frame to check if there's any compressed voice data available. If voice data is
        available, then you need to use
        <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamUser#GetVoice" class="bb_apilink"
            >ISteamUser::GetVoice</a
        >
        to get the latest audio data from the microphone.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Sending</strong><br />
        Once you have the voice data, you'll likely want to send it to the other players. The Steam
        Voice API does not provide the means of doing so directly but, this can be done with any
        networking library of your choice. The
        <a
            href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/features/multiplayer/matchmaking"
            class="bb_doclink"
            >Steam peer-to-peer networking</a
        >
        APIs are a great option for this.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Receiving</strong><br />
        When the target users receive the voice data, they call
        <a
            href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamUser#DecompressVoice"
            class="bb_apilink"
            >ISteamUser::DecompressVoice</a
        >
        to turn the compressed data back into audio.<br />
        Optionally you may want to use
        <a
            href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamUser#GetVoiceOptimalSampleRate"
            class="bb_apilink"
            >ISteamUser::GetVoiceOptimalSampleRate</a
        >
        to get the sample rate of the Steam Voice decompressor before calling
        <a
            href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamUser#DecompressVoice"
            class="bb_apilink"
            >ISteamUser::DecompressVoice</a
        >, this will result in lower CPU usage, but may sound worse.
    </li>
</ul>
