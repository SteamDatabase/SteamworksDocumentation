<h1>Steam Screenshots</h1>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Overview</h2>
Screenshot support is provided automatically through the
<a href="/doc/features/overlay">Steam Overlay</a> to every game through Steam and Steamworks
provides a set of APIs designed to interact with this system. The Steamworks Screenshots API allows
you to take screenshots and add them to a users local screenshot library with additional metadata
such as the name of a location in your game or tagging users that appear in the screenshot.

        <strong>NOTE</strong>: The <a href="/doc/features/overlay">Steam Overlay</a> must be active
        in your game for the Screenshots system to be available.

Users can press a hotkey controlled by Steam (F12 by default), to trigger a screenshot.<br />
<br />
The user can change the hotkey and other screenshot settings that will take effect in any game they
play in Steam by going to Settings -&gt; In-Game.<br />

/>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="2"></a>Screenshot Uploader</h2>
Upon quitting a game the Screenshot Uploader will automatically open with all of the screenshots
that were taken during the previous session. Users can disable this behavior by going to Settings
-&gt; Cloud and unchecking "Open the screenshot uploader after closing game if screenshots were
taken".<br />

    alt="screenshot_uploader.png"
    title="screenshot_uploader.png"
/><br />
<br />
The Screenshot Uploader can also be accessed at any time through Steam by going to View -&gt;
Screenshots or by clicking on "Screenshots" in the Steam Overlay.<br />
<br />
If the user uploads any screenshots they will be visible on their community profile, and your games
community hub.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="3"></a>Steam Screenshots API</h2>
The Steamworks SDK provides access to <a href="/doc/api/ISteamScreenshots">ISteamScreenshots</a>,
and enables you to use advanced features and integrate the Steam Screenshots system right into your
game for the best experience for your customers.<br />
<br />
By default Steam will handle taking screenshots, but you can take over control by hooking the
screenshots using
<a href="/doc/api/ISteamScreenshots#HookScreenshots">ISteamScreenshots::HookScreenshots</a>. If
you're hooking the screenshots you'll be getting a
<a href="/doc/api/ISteamScreenshots#ScreenshotRequested_t">ScreenshotRequested_t</a> callback when
the user presses the screenshot hotkey. You can check if you're currently hooking screenshots with
<a href="/doc/api/ISteamScreenshots#IsScreenshotsHooked">ISteamScreenshots::IsScreenshotsHooked</a
>.<br />
<br />
Regardless of whether you're hooking or not, you will be getting a
<a href="/doc/api/ISteamScreenshots#ScreenshotReady_t">ScreenshotReady_t</a> callback when the
screenshot has been successfully saved to disk. After receiving this callback you should then check
the result, and if it was successful, you can then use the
<a href="/doc/api/ISteamScreenshots#ScreenshotHandle">ScreenshotHandle</a> provided to set tags
with:<br />
<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="/doc/api/ISteamScreenshots#SetLocation">ISteamScreenshots::SetLocation</a><br />
    </li>
    <li><a href="/doc/api/ISteamScreenshots#TagUser">ISteamScreenshots::TagUser</a><br /></li>
    <li>
        <a href="/doc/api/ISteamScreenshots#TagPublishedFile"
            >ISteamScreenshots::TagPublishedFile</a
        >
    </li>
</ul>
<br />
If you want to take a screenshot either with your own button, or automatically at some point, such
as the end of a round, you can do that programmatically with
<a href="/doc/api/ISteamScreenshots#TriggerScreenshot">ISteamScreenshots::TriggerScreenshot</a> or
by writing the RGB bytes out with
<a href="/doc/api/ISteamScreenshots#WriteScreenshot">ISteamScreenshots::WriteScreenshot</a>, or by
adding a file from the disk with
<a href="/doc/api/ISteamScreenshots#AddScreenshotToLibrary"
    >ISteamScreenshots::AddScreenshotToLibrary</a
>/<a href="/doc/api/ISteamScreenshots#AddVRScreenshotToLibrary"
    >ISteamScreenshots::AddVRScreenshotToLibrary</a
>.
