        <h5>In Brief</h5>
        Steam Workshop is a place for your fans and community members to participate in the creation
        of content for your game.
        <h5>Level of integration</h5>
        Fairly advanced, but depends on your usage. You'll need to create an upload path in your
        game or separate tool. Plus, either hand-integrating content into your game or making your
        game load downloaded mods from disc.

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Overview</h2>
The Steam Workshop is designed as a place for your fans and community members to participate in the
creation of content for your game. The form of this creation by community members can vary depending
on the nature of the game and what kind of control you wish to have over the content in your
game.<br />
<br />
This page is intended as an overview of the Steam Workshop and the different models available. For
technical details on implementing Steam Workshop with your title, please see the

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="3"></a>Workshop Types</h2>
There are two main types of Steam Workshop integration options available. Each has benefits and
trade-offs, so you should think carefully about which option makes the most sense for your
product.<br />
<ol>
    <li>
        <a href="#ready-to-use_workshop">Ready-to-use Workshop</a> - Anyone can upload content and
        players can download content without any curation. This is best suited for supporting a
        larger number of items, mods, or maps in your game, that are either simple or complex in
        nature. You will likely need to do more work ahead of time to make an appropriate editor or
        validation tool to make sure that authored content will function properly in your game.
        Authors of these items will be able to update their content any time.<br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="#curated_workshop">Curated Workshop</a> - This is best suited to maintaining
        tighter control over the items that are added and made available in your game, but requires
        work and an update to add each item to your game. This is typically better for smaller and
        less complex pieces of content such as weapons, hats, or other accessory items. If these
        items are sold, a persistent item storage service (such as
        <a href="/doc/features/inventory">Steam Inventory Service</a>) must be used to keep track of
        which users have authority to equip items in-game, and a store must be built in-game to sell
        items. Pricing is controlled by the developer.
    </li>
</ol>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="ready-to-use_workshop"></a>Ready-To-Use Workshop</h2>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="4"></a>Why To Use</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Want to support a larger number of items.</strong> A Ready-To-Use workshop makes it
        easier to support a large number of items, mods, or maps in your game, that are either
        simple or complex in nature. By building the creation and editing tools up front, you enable
        customers to do more with your game.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Want authors to be able to update content any time.</strong> Authors of ready-to-use
        items can update their items, which means they can edit content, patch bugs, or expand the
        content and experience of their mod or item.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="5"></a>Getting Started</h2>
The best way to get started is to think about what kind of content is best suited for your customers
to create to expand your game. For multi-player games you may have different kinds of content that
makes sense than if you have a single-player game. Once you've figured that out, then you'll need to
think about how your client will load the content and what kind of tools are necessary for customers
to create that content. If you've got a game that customers are excited about, then they'll figure
out ways of making the content for your game. But, as mentioned earlier, if you wish to support
large scale modding of your game, you'll find it useful to release as much of your own development
tools as possible to aid in the creation of content and modification of your game logic.<br />
<br />
Once you've got basic modding up and running, then you'll need to integrate the
<a href="/doc/api/ISteamUGC">ISteamUGC</a> API so that your client can know which Workshop files the
user is subscribed to and can download content as necessary. From there, enabling the option to sell
items in this environment is trivial. The Steam Workshop takes care of collecting bank and tax info
from authors, provides the tools for specifying pricing, provides the necessary user agreements, and
handles all the backend payment processing and tax witholding. Your game just needs to figure out
which files to load into your game client.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="6"></a>Integration Work</h2>
Here are some of the typical components to think about for integration of the Ready-To-Use Workshop
model with your game:<br />
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Loading content into a single-player game client</strong> - If you intend for
        content submitted by customers to be ready to use within your game, then you'll need to
        structure your game appropriately to handle content in that way. Typically this means your
        game will need to check for files to load. If you are building a new implementation, we
        suggest that your game client first check for the Steam user's list of subscribed files and
        then load the corresponding folders. You will also need to have some kind of staging
        environment so that mod creators have a place to work on their mods and be able to load from
        that directory.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Loading content into a multi-player game client</strong> - If you have items or
        content that multiple users need in order for the game to function properly, you can
        download those items to all clients that need the particular item. For example, if a single
        user has subscribed to a custom map on the workshop and then invites his friends to join
        that match, your game should be able to recognize that it is a custom map and download the
        content from the Workshop for the other users before fully connecting to that match.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Uploading entries from item authors</strong> - You'll need a tool for item authors
        to upload their entries to your Workshop using the
        <a href="/doc/api/ISteamUGC">ISteamUGC</a> API. This can be as simple as a form in your game
        or it can be a stand-alone app. Since the items you are accepting should be ready-to-use,
        then your submission tool should accept just the file formats your game client expects to
        load, along with an preview image. Depending on the content you are asking authors to
        upload, you might need your own editing tools (especially necessary for any large-scale
        modding of your game such as game logic, gameplay, or anything beyond changes to existing
        visuals). For example, most moddable games have released their own developer tools so that
        mod-authors can utilize the same tools that the developer has used. These tools can also
        restrict and validate the content being submitted if you wish to control things like which
        files can be overwritten or what aspects of the game can be changed. As part of the
        information you provide to potential Workshop item authors, you'll also want to create a
        style guide and potentially a set of guidelines about the kinds of content you are looking
        for and the kinds of content you don't wish to see posted.<br />
        <br />
        See the
        <a href="/doc/features/workshop/implementation">Steam Workshop Implementation Guide</a> for
        detailed information on how to get started using the Steam Workshop portion of the
        <a href="/doc/sdk/api">Steamworks API</a>.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="7"></a>Getting Items to Customers</h2>
With the Ready-To-Use Workshop model, items listed in the Workshop are automatically available to
subscribe to (if free) or to purchase (if paid) and then are automatically downloaded via the Steam
client (Integration of the <a href="/doc/api/ISteamUGC">ISteamUGC</a> API with your product is
necessary for this to work correctly. See the technical documentation on the
<a href="/doc/features/workshop/implementation">Steam Workshop Implementation Guide</a>). The Steam
Workshop handles keeping the client up to date with any mod updates. If the mod was purchased, then
Steam handles purchase of the item, payment processing, payments to the authors, payments to the
game developer, and any necessary tax withholding.<br />
<br />
If you wish, you can build an in-game Workshop browser to list the same set of items.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="curated_workshop"></a>Curated Workshop</h2>
The defining characteristic of a curated Steam Workshop is that as the developer, you will need to
approve each item and you'll probably need an item server (Or to use the
<a href="/doc/features/inventory">Steam Inventory Service</a>) for managing ownership of the items.
This process affords a lot of control over the items that get added to your game, but typically
involves at least a small amount of work to accept each new item.<br />
<br />
Within a Curated Workshop, the items posted in the Workshop are not available for direct use by
other customers via the Workshop, but are instead presented in a queue for customers to vote on.
This voting gives you data on which items are desired by the most users and helps you filter out
incomplete or inappropriate submissions.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="8"></a>Why To Use</h2>
The Curated Workshop model is useful for your game if you:<br />
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Need to assign specific attributes to each item.</strong> If you are accepting items
        such as weapons via the Workshop, it may be important for you to be able to assign the
        attributes of the weapon such as speed, power, damage, reload time, etc. in order to best
        balance the gameplay in your title.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Want tight control over the content added to your game.</strong> Depending on how
        you've set up your game, you can accept items in two different ways:<br />
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Download and build</strong> - If you want to download the assets to your
                local machine and include it in your game depots. This gives you the opportunity to
                edit or modify the item if you need to optimize or wish to impose strict style
                guides to each of your items.<br />
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Direct to client</strong> - If you want each accepted item to download
                directly to clients as needed. This will allow item authors to update their
                creations to address bugs.<br />
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="9"></a>Getting Started</h2>
You can get started right away by setting up your curated Workshop page, adding a simple form within
your game, and posting guidelines and style guide information for potential item creators. To upload
content to the Workshop, you'll need to integrate the <a href="/doc/api/ISteamUGC">ISteamUGC</a> API
(See the <a href="/doc/features/workshop/implementation">Steam Workshop Implementation Guide</a>).
This will let item authors start coming up with ideas and posting their items to your Workshop for
evaluation by the community. We typically suggest that you ask item authors to post finished items
to the Workshop. If you allow users to post incomplete work or mere concepts, then you will need to
figure out what the process would be that those concepts get turned into real items, which typically
becomes a difficult to scale up in any meaningful way.<br />
<br />
Once you have your Workshop up and running, you can be working on integrating with the
<a href="/doc/features/microtransactions">Steam Microtransactions</a> API and the
<a href="/doc/features/inventory">Steam Inventory Service</a> in anticipation of selling the
accepted items. When you have your store ready to go, you can then start accepting items, setting
payment rules, and selling those items.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="10"></a>Integration Work</h2>
Here are some of the typical components to think about for integration of the Curated Workshop model
with your game:<br />
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Accepting entries from item authors</strong> - You'll need a tool for item authors
        to upload their entries to your Workshop. This can be as simple as a form in your game or it
        can be a stand-alone app. You can start off with a basic uploader that just asks the
        item-maker to select a .zip file and a preview image, or you can build more validation into
        your submission path. For example, Team Fortress 2 started with just a submission form that
        asked the item author to pick a .zip file and preview image. But as we iterated on the
        process, we added a test environment and validation to make sure that the file that was
        submitted to the Workshop would be easier to integrate into the game.<br />
        <br />
        As part of the information you provide to potential Workshop item authors, you'll also want
        to create a style guide and potentially a set of guidelines about the kinds of content you
        are looking for and the kinds of content you don't wish to see posted.<br />
        <br />
        Once a user has uploaded an item to the Workshop from your submission tool, it's good
        practice to take the user to the page for the item they just posted. This will allow them to
        accept any agreements they have not already accepted, such as the Steam Subscriber Agreement
        or Workshop Agreement.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Integrating the item into your game (optional)</strong> - If you need to assign
        special attributes to an item, such as the effects of a weapon or anything else that the
        creator cannot define during upload, you'll need to download the item from the Workshop
        website and include the content in your depots. Along the way, you'll need to assign any
        appropriate attributes and make any necessary edits. The amount of work at this step will
        depend on how much validation your submission tool is doing and what the quality of content
        is that you are getting from item authors.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Or, download on the fly</strong> - If you don't need to clean up items or set
        special attributes to items yourself, you can make calls to get the owned items directly
        from the Workshop content servers. You'll use ISteamInventory (if using the
        <a href="/doc/features/inventory">Steam Inventory Service</a>), get a list of items that the
        user owns. Then for each item that the user owns, check to see if it is a Workshop item,
        then:<br />
        <ul>
            <li>
                Call <a href="/doc/api/ISteamUGC#GetItemState">ISteamUGC::GetItemState</a> with the
                workshop item ID and see if
                <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">k_EItemStateNeedsUpdate</code> is
                set or if
                <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">k_EItemStateInstalled</code> is not
                set.<br />
            </li>
            <li>
                Call <a href="/doc/api/ISteamUGC#DownloadItem">ISteamUGC::DownloadItem</a> if
                appropriate<br />
            </li>
            <li>
                Wait for the
                <a href="/doc/api/ISteamUGC#DownloadItemResult_t"
                    >ISteamUGC::DownloadItemResult_t</a
                >
                callback and make the content available in game<br />
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Inventory Service &amp; Creating item definitions</strong> - If your items are to be
        sold in-game or otherwise granted to a limited number of users, then you'll need an item
        server (or you can use the <a href="/doc/features/inventory">Steam Inventory Service</a>) to
        track ownership of each item so your game knows which clients have permission to equip the
        item. This inventory service will also be necessary for selling these items or for managing
        random drops or other events that trigger drops of items to customers.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Adding Payment Rules</strong> - Once you are ready to start selling your items,
        Steam will need to know which Workshop items are associated with which item definitions in
        your item server or in the <a href="/doc/features/inventory">Steam Inventory Service</a>.
        This link establishes payment rules so that Steam knows which users to allocate the
        appropriate portion of revenue from each sale of the item. So when your inventory service
        triggers a sale through the
        <a href="/doc/features/microtransactions">Steam Microtransactions</a> API, Steam will know
        which Workshop item has been purchased and will take care of the right revenue calculation
        and payments to the author(s) of that item.<br />
        <br />
        You can manage your payment rules by clicking on the "Enter New Payment Rules" option under
        the Workshop tab of the Steamworks settings page for your app.<br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Selling the items</strong> - If you plan to have a store to sell these items, you
        can create the UI for the store yourself within your own game or you can make use of the
        Steam Item Store. For each purchase, Steam will take care of the back-end details such
        as:<br />
        <ul>
            <li>
                Collecting and maintaining bank and tax information on each Workshop item author<br />
            </li>
            <li>
                Calculating and issuing appropriate payouts to each item author based on the items
                sold<br />
            </li>
            <li>Witholding necessary income tax for each item author<br /></li>
            <li>Issuing end of year tax documents to each item author<br /></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="11"></a>Getting Items to Customers</h2>
With the Curated Workshop model, there are a number of ways you can allow customers to get the
items:<br />
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Sold in an in-game store via microtransactions</strong> - If you are using your own
        inventory service, this will require integration with the
        <a href="/doc/features/microtransactions">Steam Microtransactions</a> API. Or you can use
        the <a href="/doc/features/inventory">Steam Inventory Service</a>, which also includes a
        customizable Item Store to easily list and sell items.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Random item drops</strong> - This will require an item server (or you can use the
        <a href="/doc/features/inventory">Steam Inventory Service</a>) to manage the drops and to
        keep a record of ownership for each item.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Bundled as DLC</strong> - This typically involves less overall infrastructure, but
        will require that you work out payment terms on your own with the Workshop contributors. For
        each item sold as DLC or as part of a DLC, you'll need to come to your own agreement with
        the Workshop author as to how much you'll pay them (either a one-time payment (easier) or
        ongoing royalty percentage (requires ongoing work for you). You'll also need to keep track
        of these payments and may need to calculate necessary tax witholding and issue appropriate
        tax forms depending on where you are doing business.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Just add the items to the game for free to everyone</strong> - This requires minimal
        infrastructure, but also probably won't motivate a very high level of quality of submission
        from item authors.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="announcing_and_launching"></a>Announcing and Launching</h2>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="marketing"></a>Necessary Marketing Materials</h2>
To prepare your Workshop for launch, you'll need to supply the following items:<br />
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Workshop Header Image</strong> - This image is intended to give a recognizable feel
        of your product to the home page. We have a Photoshop template for this
        <a
            class="bb_docfile"
            href="https://cdn.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/Workshop_header_template.psd"
            target="_blank"
            >here</a
        >. This should use some recognizable artwork from your game as well as your game logo.
        Please leave some neutral space on the right side for a brief title and sentence about how
        your product makes use of the Steam Workshop.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Brief Description</strong> - You should write up a title and one or two lines of
        text about how your application uses the Steam Workshop. This will help set customer
        expectations about what they might find and how they might use your tools.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Documentation for your tools</strong> - if you already have documentation on your
        website or a wiki that helps users get started with your tools, please enter in the URL on
        the Workshop configuration page for your app. Otherwise, you may want to consider creating a
        Steam Guide for your game to introduce new users to the tools used to create content for
        your Workshop.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="12"></a>Launch Announcement &amp; Timing</h2>
When you launch your Workshop integration, it may be a great opportunity to run a discount on your
product to capitalize on the additional buzz of the new Workshop and to get a bunch of new players
to use the Workshop. You can configure your own discount to run in conjunction with your Workshop
launch. For more details, please see the
<a href="/doc/marketing/discounts">Discounting</a> documentation.<br />
<br />
Additionally, you can use an Update Visibility Round to get front-page visibility for your game to
promote your new Workshop and sale (if you are running one). For more information on Visibility
Rounds, please see <a href="/doc/marketing/visibility">Visibility on Steam</a> documentation.<br />
<br />
With a broad announcement of Workshop as a marketing tool, we find it helpful for potential
customers if there is some amount of content already available in the Workshop for your game. It
gives new customers a deeper sense of what your game is, and also shows an active and engaged user
base. It also gives existing customers something actionable to do right away, and shows content
creators what kinds of things they can create for your Workshop. At the very least, one item will
need to be published in your Workshop for your game to appear at all in the list on the front page
of the Steam Workshop.<br />
<br />
There are a couple ways to accomplish this:<br />
<ol>
    <li>
        It is possible to run a closed beta and invite some number of users in if you’d like to test
        with a small group and generate content quietly before launch. More information on running
        betas can be found in the next topic below.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Or, you could opt to create a few items internally as a demonstration of what can be done
        with your tools.
    </li>
</ol>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="13"></a>Running a private beta</h2>
Steam and the Steam Workshop makes it easy to run a private beta to allow a group of early testers
to use your new tools and test the integration with the Workshop. This is a great way to get
feedback on the flow of generating content and publishing and also to potentially launching your
Workshop with a collection of items ready for fans to check out.<br />
<br />
There are two parts to this:<br />

        Beta of your game (via Steam) - The first step is to create an updated build of your game
        and set it as a beta in Steam. This enables Steam to deliver a separate version of your game
        that customers have to opt in to and can be optionally password protected.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Beta of your Workshop (via Group) - You can set up a group in the Steam Community and use
        membership in that group to gate access to the Steam Workshop. Or, you can simply open
        access to all customers that own your application.<br />
        <ol>
            <li>
                Create a Steam Community group to use for testing. You might want to leave it
                private if you plan to restrict access to only people you want to select.<br />
            </li>
            <li>
                Get the Steam ID from that group. From your group, click "Edit Group Profile" and
                find the "ID" at the top of that page (ex: 2667495)<br />
            </li>
            <li>
                In the Steamworks admin for your game, under the "Workshop" tab, click "General",
                then set the Visibility State to "Developers &amp; Testers". You will be prompted to
                enter that ID. Publish your changes.<br />

<strong>Q. Can uploads be made from a game or tool via Family Sharing?</strong><br />
A. No, uploading to the Steam Workshop cannot be done by a user that has a temporary license for the
game or tool that does the uploading. This means users cannot upload content if they only own your
game via Family Sharing or via another temporary license such as a Free Weekend.
