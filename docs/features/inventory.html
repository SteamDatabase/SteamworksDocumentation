<h1>Steam Inventory Service</h1>
The Steam Inventory Service is a set of features that allow a game to enable persistent player
inventories without having to run special servers to manage users or items.<br />

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="Description"></a>Description</h2>
The Inventory Service can be used in two ways - either server-less or with the addition of a trusted
server that knows game state.<br />
<br />
Without a game server, the game client can communicate directly to the steam service to retrieve
users inventory contents, consume and exchange items, and receive new items granted as an effect of
playtime. Users can also purchase items directly from the Item Store, or trade and exchange markets
in the Steam community.<br />
<br />
However because the client can't be trusted (and the keys in a client can always be captured by an
attacker) you can't give users specific items in this scheme. Rather you select certain items that
can be dropped, and configure a drop frequency. At appropriate times, the game client invokes
<a href="/doc/api/ISteamInventory#TriggerItemDrop">ISteamInventory::TriggerItemDrop</a>. Steam
servers manage the playtime and drop frequency per-player. These APIs are called using an internal
"Client API Key" that is assumed to be untrusted.<br />
<br />
If you have a participating trusted server then you can use a privileged Steam API key on the server
and grant explicit items for appropriate situations. It is still important to keep in mind that you
can't trust your own clients so you can only do this when the server is the master of the state of
the game.<br />
<br />
Finally in conjunction with the Inventory Service you can sell an individual item or a cart of
items, <a href="/doc/features/inventory/webfunctions#BuyItem">in-game</a> or through a web-based
<a href="/doc/features/inventory/itemstore">storefront</a>.<br />

specific problems that the Inventory Service solves for developers, and demonstration on how
partners are already using the system to serve their customers.<br />

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="ImplementationOverview"></a>Implementation Overview</h2>
<ol>
    <li>
        <strong>Create Item Definitions</strong><br />
        You'll need to start by creating and uploading some
        <a href="/doc/features/inventory/schema">item definitions</a> (ItemDefs).<br />
        These describe the possible set of items in your game. You don't need to use these from your
        game itself but Steam needs them to display inventory correctly. To create ItemDefs, go to
        the Steam Inventory section of your Steamworks configuration area. You can get there from
        here:
        <a href="/apps/inventoryservice/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
            >https://partner.steamgames.com/apps/inventoryservice/</a
        ><br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Enable Inventory Service</strong><br />
        Once you have item definitions, turn on the Inventory Service by checking "Enable Inventory
        Service" on the page you uploaded your item definitions. Note that while your item
        visibility is set to Private in the Steam Economy Settings, only accounts in your Steamworks
        Partner group will be able to access your items in-game.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Set Asset Server Key</strong><br />
        First generate a Publisher Web API key for your application (instructions:
        <a href="/doc/webapi_overview/auth#create_publisher_key">Creating a Publisher Web API Key</a
        >) and put it into the Asset Server Key field in the Steam Economy Settings.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Download Users Inventory</strong><br />
        Have your game client download the users inventory by calling
        <a href="/doc/api/ISteamInventory#GetAllItems">ISteamInventory::GetAllItems</a>.<br />
        Its usually good to do this periodically in case the user has added more items via trading
        or purchase.<br />
        Depending on your game, a check at the beginning of each game or level might be
        appropriate.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Grant Test Items</strong><br />
        Use <a href="/doc/api/ISteamInventory#GenerateItems">ISteamInventory::GenerateItems</a> to
        add specific items to the current players account for development purposes.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Grant User a Playtime Drop (optional)</strong><br />
        At appropriate times (typically the end of a match/phase) call
        <a href="/doc/api/ISteamInventory#TriggerItemDrop">ISteamInventory::TriggerItemDrop</a> to
        see if the user has earned a new drop.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Sell Items (optional)</strong><br />
        To add microtransaction support, define prices in your itemdefs. You can then have people
        purchase them in a few different ways:<br />
        <ul>
            <li>
                Using the customizable, web-based
                <a href="/doc/features/inventory/itemstore">Item Store</a><br />
            </li>
            <li>
                Implement your own in-game store:<br />
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Retrieve the user's local currency and prices by calling
                        <a href="/doc/api/ISteamInventory#RequestPrices"
                            >ISteamInventory::RequestPrices</a
                        ><br />
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Display prices returned by
                        <a href="/doc/api/ISteamInventory#GetItemPrice"
                            >ISteamInventory::GetItemPrice</a
                        >
                        or
                        <a href="/doc/api/ISteamInventory#GetNumItemsWithPrices"
                            >ISteamInventory::GetNumItemsWithPrices</a
                        >
                        &amp;
                        <a href="/doc/api/ISteamInventory#GetItemsWithPrices"
                            >ISteamInventory::GetItemsWithPrices</a
                        ><br />
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Call
                        <a href="/doc/api/ISteamInventory#StartPurchase"
                            >ISteamInventory::StartPurchase</a
                        >
                        with the item definitions that the user wants to purchase<br />
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Handle the
                        <a href="/doc/api/ISteamInventory#SteamInventoryResultReady_t"
                            >SteamInventoryResultReady_t</a
                        >
                        callback to give users any items they have purchased or acquired.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Use the
