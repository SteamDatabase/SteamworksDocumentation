<h1>Templates for In-Game Actions Files</h1>
Here are some example templates for
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/features/steam_controller/iga_file" class="bb_doclink"
    >IGA files</a

that you can use as starting points for your games. None of these are for any specific game, and
your game might have specific needs not covered by any of them, so feel free to experiment. This is
just to give you a useful skeleton to build upon.<br /><br />

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="rts"></a> Real Time Strategy</h2>
<br />This is for a Real Time Strategy game where you build units &amp; buildings and command units
individually or in groups. A few special things are going on here -- first of all, there's two
<a
    href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/features/steam_controller/action_set_layers"
    class="bb_doclink"
    >action layers</a
>
for the Unit and Build menus, but it's also set up to use actions in chords.<br /><br />In this
game, you can assign units, buildings, or groups of units to ten groups bound to ten hotkeys
(implemented here as actions "Group 0" through "Group 9"). After you activate an action such as
"assign_group" or "add_remove_group", the game's programming will wait until an action such as
"group_0" or "group_3" is pressed. "assign_group" + "group_2" means, "assign the current selection
to group 2," whereas "select_group" + "group_5" means, "select everything currently assigned to
group 5." This sort of thing has to be implemented by the game's own logic, but it's much simpler
than creating individual action permutations for each slot, ie "add_remove_group_2",
"assign_group_2", "select_group_2", etc...<br /><br />Additionally, the Unit commands have the
special action "queue." When an order action is received, if the game detects that the "queue"
action is also currently being fired, it will not immediately execute the original order, but
instead stick it on queue for that unit. When done with a "move" order this could be used to set
waypoints, for instance. Again, this sort of logic would need to be implemented by the game
itself.<br /><br />

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="4x"></a> 4X Strategy</h2>
<br />This is a simple 4X strategy game, where you move units on a main map, colonize territory
(whether that's planets or islands or cities), and engage in combat with other empires. Base actions
such as "click", "cancel", "select", and "inspect" are always available in the base action set,
whereas other actions come in via
<a
    href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/features/steam_controller/action_set_layers"
    class="bb_doclink"
    >action set layers</a
>
depending on context. For instance, in the main map you have additional actions such as ending the
turn, or cycling between your colonies. In battle, you can cycle between units, and tell them to
move, attack, or retreat.<br /><br />

<br />A simple console-style JRPG where you move a character avatar around a map environment such as
an overworld, dungeon, or town, and can interact with things. The game features a modal battle
system that mostly uses the same basic menu-driven actions (up/down/left/right/select/cancel), but
has some special commands like toggling a special power between targetting an individual and a group
of enemies, skipping a character's turn, and pausing the game.<br /><br />
