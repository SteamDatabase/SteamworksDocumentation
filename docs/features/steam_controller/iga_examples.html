<h1>Templates for In-Game Actions Files</h1>
Here are some example templates for
<a href="/doc/features/steam_controller/iga_file">IGA files</a> that you can use as starting points
for your games. None of these are for any specific game, and your game might have specific needs not
covered by any of them, so feel free to experiment. This is just to give you a useful skeleton to
build upon.<br />

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="rts"></a> Real Time Strategy</h2>
<br />
This is for a Real Time Strategy game where you build units &amp; buildings and command units
individually or in groups. A few special things are going on here -- first of all, there's two
<a href="/doc/features/steam_controller/action_set_layers">action layers</a> for the Unit and Build
menus, but it's also set up to use actions in chords.<br />
<br />
In this game, you can assign units, buildings, or groups of units to ten groups bound to ten hotkeys
(implemented here as actions "Group 0" through "Group 9"). After you activate an action such as
"assign_group" or "add_remove_group", the game's programming will wait until an action such as
"group_0" or "group_3" is pressed. "assign_group" + "group_2" means, "assign the current selection
to group 2," whereas "select_group" + "group_5" means, "select everything currently assigned to
group 5." This sort of thing has to be implemented by the game's own logic, but it's much simpler
than creating individual action permutations for each slot, ie "add_remove_group_2",
"assign_group_2", "select_group_2", etc...<br />
<br />
Additionally, the Unit commands have the special action "queue." When an order action is received,
if the game detects that the "queue" action is also currently being fired, it will not immediately
execute the original order, but instead stick it on queue for that unit. When done with a "move"
order this could be used to set waypoints, for instance. Again, this sort of logic would need to be
implemented by the game itself.<br />

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="4x"></a> 4X Strategy</h2>
<br />
This is a simple 4X strategy game, where you move units on a main map, colonize territory (whether
that's planets or islands or cities), and engage in combat with other empires. Base actions such as
"click", "cancel", "select", and "inspect" are always available in the base action set, whereas
other actions come in via
<a href="/doc/features/steam_controller/action_set_layers">action set layers</a> depending on
context. For instance, in the main map you have additional actions such as ending the turn, or
cycling between your colonies. In battle, you can cycle between units, and tell them to move,
attack, or retreat.<br />

A simple console-style JRPG where you move a character avatar around a map environment such as an
overworld, dungeon, or town, and can interact with things. The game features a modal battle system

special commands like toggling a special power between targetting an individual and a group of
enemies, skipping a character's turn, and pausing the game.<br />
