<h1>Action Set Layers</h1>
Action Set Layers are optional sets of action bindings which can be overlaid
upon an existing set of controls. In contrast to Action Sets, layers draw their
actions from the Action Set they exist within and do not wholesale replace what
is already active when applied, but apply small modifications. These can consist
of setting changes as well as adding or removing bindings from the base action
set. More than one layer can be applied at a time and will be applied
consecutively.<br /><br />There is technically no limit to how many layers can
be active at once, but as a practical matter, having too many layers in the
configurator will be confusing for players.<br /><br /><strong

        <h3>Careful with multiple layers!</h3>
        Just because you <i>can</i> re-apply action set layers every frame
        doesn't mean you <i>should</i>, especially if you're using more than one
        layer. The last layer applied will override any conflicting information
        that came before, so take special care to apply them in the correct
        order. Your code could easily have race conditions or other subtle
        timing bugs that could swap the order.<br /><br />Action set layers are
        intended for narrow use cases and a good practice is to apply and remove
        them only on specific game state changes.

    <br />For games with native Steam Input support, the developer can define
    specific action set layers activated by the game's code. Additionally, in
    legacy mode, players can define their own action set layers and the inputs
    that trigger them, just as they can define their own player-triggered action
    sets.
    <h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>A practical example</h2>
    <br />Imagine a class-based shooter with vehicles. This game has native
    Steam Input support and makes use of action set layers. For basic gameplay,
    a base action set is always active and covers running around, picking up
    items, jumping, etc.<br /><br /><img
      src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/action_set_layers_basic_1.png"
      alt="action_set_layers_basic_1.png"
      title="action_set_layers_basic_1.png"
    /><br /><br />When the player selects a class, the appropriate layer is
    added, e.g. "sniper"<br /><br /><img
      src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/action_set_layers_sniper_2.png"
      alt="action_set_layers_sniper_2.png"
      title="action_set_layers_sniper_2.png"
    /><br /><br />The code for this might look something like:<br /><br />
    <div class="bb_code cpp">
      void changeClass(EClassID myClass) { if(myClass == SNIPER) {
      SteamController()-&gt;ActivateActionSetLayer( controllerHandle1,
      sniperLayerHandle ); } //logic for other classes }
    </div>
    <br />If the player enters or exits a vehicle, the controls for the vehicle
    layer are activated/deactivated on those state changes, adding or removing
    new controls for vehicle specific functions. <br /><br /><img
      src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/action_set_layers_vehicle_1.png"
      alt="action_set_layers_vehicle_1.png"
      title="action_set_layers_vehicle_1.png"
    /><br /><br />
    <div class="bb_code cpp">
      void changeVehicle(EVehicleID myVehicle, bool entering) {
      ControllerActionSetHandle_t layerHandle; if(myVehicle == AUTOMATIC) {
      layerHandle = automaticHandle; //automatic transmission -- steer, gas,
      brake } else if(myVehicle == STICK_SHIFT) { layerHandle =
      stickShiftHandle; //manual transmission -- steer, gas, brake, clutch,
      shift gears, etc. } if(entering) {
      SteamController()-&gt;ActivateActionSetLayer( controllerHandle1,
      layerHandle ); //apply the vehicle's action set layer when you get in it }
      else { SteamController()-&gt;DeactivateActionSetLayer( controllerHandle1,
      layerHandle ); //remove the vehicle's action set layer when you get out of
      it } }
    </div>
    <br />In this game, players can use their weapon even when riding in a
    vehicle. So when the sniper uses the scope on the sniper rifle, this
    activates a third action set layer, regardless of whether the player is on
    foot or riding in a vehicle.<br /><br /><img
      src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/action_set_layers_scope.png"
      alt="action_set_layers_scope.png"
      title="action_set_layers_scope.png"
    /><br /><br />
    <div class="bb_code cpp">
      void useScope(bool entering) { if(entering) {
      SteamController()-&gt;ActivateActionSetLayer( controllerHandle1,
      scopeHandle ); //apply the scoped-in layer when you scope in } else {
      SteamController()-&gt;DeactivateActionSetLayer( controllerHandle1,
      scopeHandle ); //remove the scoped-in layer when you lower the scope } }
    </div>
    <br />Here's how all the layers combine. <br /><br /><img
      src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/action_set_layers_result_2.png"
      alt="action_set_layers_result_2.png"
      title="action_set_layers_result_2.png"
    /><br /><br />Note how layers can not only add new actions on top of
    underyling layers, they can also override previous bindings -- in this case,
    the vehicle-specific "brake" and "gas" actions override the basic layer's
    "jump" and "interaction" actions, and "steer" overrides the "move" action
    bound to the trackpad and joystick on the base layer, and in turn is
    overriden by the "aim" action from the scoped-in action set layer. Once all
    three action set layers are stacked on top, the only remaining action from
    the base set is "shoot."
    <h2 class="bb_section"><a name="2"></a>Legacy Mode</h2>
    <br />You create action set layers almost exactly like regular action sets.
    Simply click on the button "Add Action Layer" in the configurator:<br /><br /><img
      src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/add_action_layer.png"
      alt="add_action_layer.png"
      title="add_action_layer.png"
    /><br /><br />From here you can give your action set layer a name and
    specify bindings for it. Since this is a legacy action set layer, the game
    has no knowledge of it and the player will have to activate it themselves.
    Decide what input should trigger the action set layer, and open the binding
    menu, then click the action set activation icon, which is the leftmost
    special icon:<br /><br /><img
      src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/bind_action_set.png"
      alt="bind_action_set.png"
      title="bind_action_set.png"
    /><br /><br />This brings up the action set activation menu:<br /><br /><img
      src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/change_action_set.png"
      alt="change_action_set.png"
      title="change_action_set.png"
    /><br /><br />In this case we want to apply a layer, not activate an action
    set. We'll select "Apply Action Layer" from the dropdown menu:<br /><br /><img
      src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/apply_action_set_layer.png"
      alt="apply_action_set_layer.png"
      title="apply_action_set_layer.png"
    /><br /><br />Finally, we need to select which layer we want to apply:<br /><br /><img
      src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/select_action_set_layer.png"
      alt="select_action_set_layer.png"
      title="select_action_set_layer.png"
    /><br /><br />We can use the same procedure to assign a separate binding to
    remove the layer.
  </li>
</ul>
