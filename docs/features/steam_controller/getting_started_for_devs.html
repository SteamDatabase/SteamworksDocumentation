<h1>Getting Started for Developers</h1>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Overview</h2>
<br />The Steam Input API is designed to allow you to easily enable <i>full support</i> for Steam
Input devices in your game. We define full support as the follows:<br /><br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        Your game uses the proper controller-specific glyphs when showing in-game input prompts.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        The Steam Input configurator screen uses in-game actions that the player performs in your
        game, instead of keys or buttons.<br />
    </li>
    <li>You've published an official configuration for the controllers you support.<br /></li>
    <li>
        Your game doesn't restrict the user's ability to customize their controls. This means it
        allows any mix of mouse, keyboard, or gamepad input simultaneously.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        When your game wants keyboard input (e.g. when naming avatars), you
        <a
            href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/features/steam_controller/getting_started_for_devs#6"
            class="bb_doclink"
            >use the API</a
        >
        to automatically bring up the text entry UI.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Your game has no launchers that require mouse or KB input - or even better, no launcher at
        all.
    </li>
</ul>
<br />To ensure users have a good experience from the couch, we also recommend the following:<br /><br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        Make your UI readable from several feet away. Our rule of thumb: when your game is running
        at 1920x1080, your fonts should be a minimum of 24px in size.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Start your game in fullscreen by default when the user is running Steam Big Picture (the
        "SteamTenfoot" environment variable will be set)<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        For bonus points, at first launch detect the user's screen resolution and set your
        resolution to match it.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="2"></a>Common Use Cases</h2>
<h2 class="bb_subsection">
    <a name="3"></a>I'm Adding Steam Input API support <i>before</i> shipping my game
</h2>
<br />Great! Follow the technical directions in

<h2 class="bb_subsection">
    <a name="4"></a>I'm Adding Steam Input API support alongside other input libraries
</h2>
<br />It's perfectly acceptable to ship conventional gamepad input as well as Steam Input, and if
you're adding Steam Input API support after initial launch or shipping your game on multiple
platforms, you could easily find yourself in this situation. There's a few things to keep in
mind:<br /><br /><strong> 1. Be deliberate with your analog action choices</strong><br />We'll be
going into further detail on this topic later but the quick summary is:<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        You should always include a mouse-style action for cursor or precision camera controls. It
        may be acceptable to skip mouse-like input in Twin Stick or Sports titles where the joystick
        position is used for directional aim. <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Avoid using the the system mouse ("os_mouse" option) unless you have a good reason to need
        it. Being able to determine if input comes from a real mouse vs a controller is an important
        part of good UX practices.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        You should <i>either</i> rely on the configurator to provide sensitivity (ie you don't
        filter incoming Steam Input data), <i>or</i> you should use a dedicated sensitivity option
        for Steam Input that's distinct from the system mouse.
    </li>
</ul>
<br /><strong> 2. Be consistent with auto-aim on joysticks </strong><br />If you have any auto-aim
or aim-assist applied to XInput analog sticks, consider applying that to Steam Input devices as
well, at least for traditional controller models configured through Steam Input. You can call
<a
    href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamController#GetInputTypeForHandle"
    class="bb_apilink"
    >GetInputTypeForHandle</a
>
to determine an individual controller's model type or implement separate mouse-style and
joystick-style camera actions.<br /><br /><strong>
    3. Use SDL version 2.0.6 or above, if possible</strong
><br />If you're using
<a href="https://www.libsdl.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">SDL</a> (Simple DirectMedia
Layer), one of the most popular cross-platform game libraries for handling things like input, make
sure you're using the latest version, or at least version 2.0.8 or above. This version allows Steam
to tell SDL to ignore input for controllers configured by Steam Input, which avoids double-input
bugs.<br /><br /><strong> 4. Have a plan for Xbox controllers </strong><br />If your game has
already shipped and has Xinput support that you're leaving in place, you may want to leave Xbox
controllers in the XInput path by default. If you're a local multiplayer game you'll want to make
sure that you can either accept input from both paths at the same time or opt all controller into
Steam Input though.

    <a name="5"></a>I Want my Non-Steam Input API Games to Play Nicely with Steam Input
</h2>
<br />First of all, I highly recommend reading Zach Burke's
<a
    href="https://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/ZachBurke/20151030/257920/The_5_Golden_Rules_of_Input.php"
    target="_blank"
    rel="noreferrer"
    >The Five Golden Rules of Input</a
>.<br /><br />To summarize, they are:<br /><br />
<ol class="bb_ol">
    <li><strong>On-screen icons should match the input device</strong><br /></li>
    <li><strong>Mouse cursor should match the input device</strong><br /></li>
    <li><strong>All devices should work 100% of the time</strong><br /></li>
    <li><strong>Dpad, analog stick, and mouse can all be used to navigate menus</strong><br /></li>
    <li><strong>A disconnected gamepad should pause the game</strong></li>
</ol>
<br />These are good general guidelines to follow if you are able. To add our own emphasis:<br /><br /><strong>
    Gamepad and mouse input should be possible simultaneously </strong
><br /><br />Most games allow mouse input, or gamepad input, but not both at the same time, and this
is the chief cause of compatibility issues with the Steam Input system.
<br /><br />Additionally:<br /><br />
<ol class="bb_ol">
    <li>
        <strong>Set a recommended controller configuration for all controller types</strong
        ><br />This way Steam doesn't have to prompt the user to select a configuration on startup.
        By the way, you don't need to provide a configuration for both the Xbox 360 and the Xbox One
        controllers -- if you only supply one, it will work for the other model.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Opt-in Controller Type you don't have native support for to Steam Input</strong
        ><br />If you don't have built-in support for these controller types, you should use the
        partner site to opt them in to using Steam Input. See the bottom of
        <a
            href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/features/steam_controller/getting_started_for_devs#21"

            >this section</a
        >
        for more on that.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>If you're not going to allow simultaneous gamepad/mouse...</strong><br />...at least
        make the deadzone, acceleration, and sensitivity of the joystick configurable. Joystick
        emulation for the trackpad works by rapidly flicking the virtual joystick so it is quite
        sensitive to these settings. For good results you want to allow very high sensitivities,
        deadzones that go to 0 and a linear acceleration curve.

        <strong
            >Allow users to select from Xbox or PS4 glyphs via the menu or detect the device type
            via our API</strong
        ><br />When Steam is sending gamepad input it will appear in your game as regular Xbox
        controller input, rather than the normal device. This is useful since it allows the player
        to use devices that would not normally work, but it also means that normal check for USB
        device ID's, etc will not work and you'll need to call a helper function from Steam. It's
        important to note here that even controllers which you have built-in support may appear in
        your game through Steam Input either because the user is streaming the game via Steam Remote
        Play or because the user has opted into Steam Input to reconfigure their devices.

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="implement_steam_input"></a>Implementing Steam Input API support</h2>
<br />The implementation process is straightforward, and shouldn't take more than a few days of
work. Four steps are involved:<br /><br />
<ol class="bb_ol">
    <li>
        In a text editor, create an in-game actions file, which tells Steam what in-game actions
        your players can bind to the controller.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        In Steam, use the Steam Input configurator UI to create your default configuration.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        In your game, use the Steam Input API to read actions from the controller, and to retrieve
        appropriate glyphs for display.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Update your game depot with the new binaries, and publish your configuration as the official
        config.
    </li>
</ol>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="iga"></a>Step 1 - Creating an In-Game Actions File</h2>
<br />Start by downloading the starting
<a
    href="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/partner/controller/game_actions_X.vdf"
    target="_blank"
    rel="noreferrer"
    >in-game actions (IGA) file</a
>. Place it in your <i>"&lt;Steam Install Directory&gt;\controller_config"</i> directory (create the
directory if it doesn't exist). Rename the file to the following: <i>"game_actions_X.vdf"</i>, where
X is your game's Steam AppID. If you don't know what your game's Steam AppID is, it can be found by
logging into your Steam partner site.<br /><br />Now open up the file in your favorite text editor.
The file is in a standard Valve format called KeyValues, which is a simple &amp; easily read format.
You might also find it useful to download one of our

for a reference.<br /><br />For more details see:
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/features/steam_controller/iga_file" class="bb_doclink"
    >In-Game Actions File</a
>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="7"></a>File Format</h2>
<br />IGA files contain an "actions" section, which should list all the in-game action sets (IGAS)
in your game. An IGAS describes all the actions a player can take within some game context - such as
when the player is in a vehicle, or on foot, or navigating the menu system. For each IGAS, the Steam
Input configuration UI will provide a tab that allows a player to customize how those actions are
bound to the controller.<br /><br />An IGAS entry in the IGA file should contain a "title" key &amp;
value, and the following subsections: "StickPadGyro", "AnalogTrigger", and "Button". The
"StickPadGyro" and "AnalogTrigger" sections each contain a list of IGAs that the player can only
assign to the stick/pad/gyro and analog triggers respectively. The "Buttons" section contains IGAs
that can only be bound to digital inputs (like the physical ABXY buttons, or a trackpad that's in
ABXY mode, or a trigger that's not being used as an AnalogTrigger action).
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="8"></a>Designing your IGA</h2>
Take a minute to think about the functionality of your game - how many distinct modes does it
contain? For each place where you want to have distinct controls you'll want to make an action set.
Most games will have at least a distinct "Menu" and "In-game" action set, but many will need more.
Does your game have any special cases like operating a vehicle or have specialized in-game menus
like a map or inventory screen, those may also be useful to make into action sets.<br /><br />Not
everything needs to be a distinct action set though, you can also use action set layers to handle
similar modes. For example if you can drive both a car and boat in your game you may want to include
one "vehicle" action set with an action set layer of "boat" or "car" on top of it. Action set layers
retain any settings of the parent action set and can make understanding and editing configurations
more manageable for both your development team and your users.<br /><br />For more information on
action set layers see:
<a
    href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/features/steam_controller/action_set_layers"
    class="bb_doclink"
    >Action set layers</a
>
<div class="bb_callout bb_red">
    <div>
        <h3><strong>Limits on the number of actions </strong></h3>
        Currently the maximum number of actions is 16 analog and 128 digital actions. It is very
        important to note that actions can be shared between action sets so in most cases you will
        only need a fraction of the maximum number of actions. This limit is not set in stone so if
        you've got a good reason for needing more, please let us know.
    </div>
</div>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="9"></a>Button Actions</h2>
<br />The format for "Button" actions is as follows: <br /><br />
<div class="bb_code">"&lt;action name&gt;" "#&lt;localization key&gt;"</div>
<br />The <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">&lt;action name&gt;</code> is the
internal name you want to refer to this action by in your game code, when talking to the Steam Input
API. The <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">&lt;localization key&gt;</code> should be
the name of an entry in your localization section (see Adding Localization). Make sure to include
the '#' character at the start of your localization key.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="10"></a>Analog Trigger Actions</h2>
<br />The format for "AnalogTrigger" actions is the same as for "Button". "AnalogTrigger" actions
should be actions that your game will be interpreting as full analog inputs, like vehicle
acceleration. If you don't have any of that kind of input, just leave the section empty. The Steam
Input configurator UI will allow players to assign any "Button" action to the physical triggers if
they're not being used as an "AnalogTrigger" action.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="11"></a>StickPadGyro Actions</h2>
<br />The format for "StickPadGyro" actions is as follows: <br /><br />
<div class="bb_code">
    "&lt;action name&gt;" { "title" "#&lt;localization key&gt;" "input_mode" "&lt;analog mode&gt;" }
</div>
<br /><code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">&lt;action name&gt;</code> and
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">&lt;localization key&gt;</code> are the same as the
matching keys in the "Button" format.
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">&lt;analog mode&gt;</code> tells us how to
interpret the data coming from the physical controls, before we pass it to your game via the steam
input API.<br /><br />Valid
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">&lt;analog modes&gt;</code> are as follows:<br /><br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">"absolute_mouse"</code> - for when you're
        expecting the action to behave like a mouse. Useful for first or third person camera, or an
        actual mouse cursor.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">"joystick_move"</code> - for when you're
        using the action to move a character around.
    </li>
</ul>
<div class="bb_callout bb_red">
    <div>
        <h3><strong>"absolute_mouse"</strong> vs. <strong>"joystick_move"</strong></h3>
        We can’t stress enough that when creating a camera input for your first/third person game or
        anything cursor driven, you should always include an <strong>"absolute_mouse"</strong> type
        action and react to deltas as if it’s a mouse as the 1:1 data is required for implementing
        good quality Gyro aim or trackpad input. Steam Input is able to convert joystick input from
        gamepads into "absolute_mouse" style input for you but due to the acceleration curves and
        deadzones applied in-game it's not possible to convert the other direction. <br /><br />It's
        fine to include a <strong>"joystick_move"</strong> style action if you want exact parity for
        joystick aim with your console builds but please test that you can accept input from both
        <strong>"absolute_mouse"</strong> and <strong>"joystick_move"</strong> at the same time so
        Playstation and Switch controllers can use Gyro aim along side the joystick. You may also
        want to implement a digital action for "Reset Camera" to re-center the vertical position of
        the camera. If you have auto aim enabled for Xinput controllers please apply the same logic
        to joystick input through Steam Input API and consider applying a lighter amount of auto aim
        for trackpad/gyro aim.
    </div>
</div>
<br />There is one optional setting for StickPadGyro actions that are using
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">"absolute_mouse"</code> as their input. If you set
the <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">"os_mouse"</code> key to
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">"1"</code>, we'll pass the input from the player
into the OS as well as your game. This is useful if you have a visible OS mouse cursor that should
be controlled by this action. <br /><br />Here's an example: <br /><br />
<div class="bb_code">
    "menu_mouse" { "title" "#Menu_Mouse_Title" "input_mode" "absolute_mouse" "os_mouse" "1" }
</div>
<div class="bb_callout bb_red">
    <div>
        <h3>Warning</h3>
        <ol class="bb_ol">
            <li>
                We <strong>strongly discourage</strong> using the "os_mouse" option for
                <strong>camera controls</strong>. If specific parts of your game are hard to patch,
                remember that you can always have separate analog actions that are used only in the
                menu vs. the in-game action sets.<br />
            </li>
            <li>
                Using "os_mouse" will cause your controller inputs to be controlled by the in-game
                mouse sensitivities and will only work for a single local player.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </div>
</div>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="12"></a>Step 1.1 - Adding Localization</h2>
<br />The "localization" section in your IGA file contains a list of languages, each of which is a
section containing localization keys &amp; values. For example: <br /><br />
<div class="bb_code">
    "localization" { "english" { "Action_Jump" "Jump" "Action_Camera" "Camera" } "german" {
    "Action_Jump" "Springen" "Action_Camera" "Kameraansicht" } }
</div>
<br />The actions in your IGA file should then specify their names by referring to the desired
localization key, preceded by the '#' character. Here are example actions using the above
localization keys:<br /><br />
<div class="bb_code">
    "StickPadGyro" { "Camera" { "title" "#Action_Camera" "input_mode" "absolute_mouse" } } "Button"
    { "Jump" "#Action_Jump" }
</div>
<br />If the language the game is running under is not found in the localization section, English
will be used as a fallback. If English is not found, the string will be shown as is. Supported
languages are as follows: <br /><br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>brazilian (Brazilian Portuguese)<br /></li>
    <li>bulgarian<br /></li>
    <li>czech<br /></li>
    <li>danish<br /></li>
    <li>dutch<br /></li>
    <li>english<br /></li>
    <li>finnish<br /></li>
    <li>french<br /></li>
    <li>german<br /></li>
    <li>greek<br /></li>
    <li>hungarian<br /></li>
    <li>italian<br /></li>
    <li>japanese<br /></li>
    <li>koreana (Korean)<br /></li>
    <li>norwegian<br /></li>
    <li>polish<br /></li>
    <li>portuguese<br /></li>
    <li>romanian<br /></li>
    <li>russian<br /></li>
    <li>schinese (Simplified Chinese)<br /></li>
    <li>spanish<br /></li>
    <li>swedish<br /></li>
    <li>tchinese (Traditional Chinese)<br /></li>
    <li>thai<br /></li>
    <li>turkish<br /></li>
    <li>ukrainian</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="13"></a>Step 1.2 - Titles &amp; Descriptions</h2>
<br />Configurations also need a localized title and description. If you're only making a single
official configuration for your game, you don't need to worry about this - we'll provide a default
title and description, and you can skip this step entirely. But if you want to have multiple
official configurations for your game, then you'll also need to provide localized titles and
descriptions for them.<br /><br />Configuration titles and descriptions should be listed along with
the rest of your localization keys. The title key must start with
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">"Title_"</code>, and the description key must start
with <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">"Description_"</code>. Here's an example:
<br /><br />
<div class="bb_code">
    "localization" { "english" { "Title_Config1" "Official Configuration" "Description_Config1"
    "This config was created by the developers of Game X." "Title_Config2" "Official Southpaw
    Configuration" "Description_Config2" "This config was created by the developers of Game X, and
    is setup for Southpaw users." "Action_Jump" "Jump" "Action_Camera" "Camera" } }
</div>
<br />When you publish a configuration (see
<a href="#publishing" class="bb_doclink">Step 4 - Publishing</a>), you'll be able to select which of
these localized titles and descriptions you want to use.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="14"></a>Step 2 - Creating a Default Configuration</h2>
<br />Once you've created your IGA file, and ensured it's in the right directory &amp; named to
match your game's AppID, you're ready to create a configuration. <br /><br />Run Steam in Big
Picture mode, and navigate to your game's game details page. <br /><br />Select "Manage Game," and
then "Configure Controller." If you receive any errors at this point, they'll be identifying issues
in your IGA file and you'll need to go fix them - the most common mistake is a missing closing quote
or brace.<br /><br />If you don't receive any errors, you're now looking at an empty controller
configuration for your game, and it should be fully aware of your in-game actions. Use the UI to
create a default configuration. Make sure you set defaults for all your in-game action sets, not
just the first one.<br /><br />Once you've got a configuration, save it privately. Don't publish it,
because your game is not yet ready to receive IGAs.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="15"></a>Step 3 - The Steam Input API</h2>
<br />Make sure you have the latest version of the Steamworks API - Grab it from the
<a
    href="https://partner.steamgames.com/documentation/getting_started"
    target="_blank"
    rel="noreferrer"
    >Getting Started With SteamWorks</a
>
page.<br /><br />Add the following command line parameters to your Steam shortcut: <br /><br />
<div class="bb_code">-forcecontrollerappid &lt;your_game's_AppID&gt;</div>
<br />This will tell steam to keep the controller locked to your game. Usually, the controller flips
its configuration as focus shifts from your game to steam or the desktop, because we use different
configurations for each of those states. This can make it trickier to debug the controller while
you're working on it, because the controller will change its configuration when you hit a breakpoint
in your debugger. Setting this
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">-forcecontrollerappid</code> option will keep the
controller locked to your game. This may have the side effect of making it less/non-functional in
the desktop or steam overlay.
<div class="bb_callout bb_red">
    <div>
        <h3>NOTE:</h3>
        By "Steam shortcut" we mean a shortcut to the Steam client itself. The command line
        parameters need to be passed to the Steam client, not your game.

<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="16"></a>Step 3.1 - API Overview</h2>
<br />The Steam Input API is built around the in-game actions &amp; sets that you specified in your
in-game actions file in Step 1. <br /><br />For a complete API reference, see
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamController" class="bb_doclink"
    >ISteamController Interface (Deprecated)</a
><br /><br />The functionality overview is as follows: <br /><br />
<ul class="bb_ul">

        <h3>Safe Interfaces</h3>
        Controller data is gathered when
        <a
            href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamController#RunFrame"
            class="bb_apilink"
            >ISteamController::RunFrame</a
        >
        is called. This is normally done for you every frame by
        <a
            href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/steam_api#SteamAPI_RunCallbacks"
            class="bb_doclink"
            >SteamAPI_RunCallbacks</a
        >. However, if you have version-safe interfaces enabled and find you're not getting good
        polling data you will need to call
        <a
            href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamController#RunFrame"
            class="bb_apilink"
            >ISteamController::RunFrame</a
        >
        every frame.<br /><br />You can tell if you have version-safe interfaces enabled by seeing
        if you have this #define in your code:<br />
        <div class="bb_code">VERSION_SAFE_STEAM_API_INTERFACES</div>
    </div>
</div>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="17"></a>Step 3.2 - Input Handling</h2>
<br />For digital actions, the data returned by
<a
    href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamController#GetDigitalActionData"
    class="bb_apilink"
    >ISteamController::GetDigitalActionData</a
>
is straightforward:<br /><br />
<div class="bb_code html">
    bState: will be true if the action is being sent by the controller (button is pressed, trigger
    pulled, etc)
</div>
<br />For analog actions, the data returned by
<a
    href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamController#GetAnalogActionData"
    class="bb_apilink"
    >ISteamController::GetAnalogActionData</a
>
is only slightly more complex:<br /><br />
<div class="bb_code html">
    x,y: will depend on the mode you assigned the game action to in your IGA File. -
    "absolute_mouse": x &amp; y will be deltas from the previous mouse position. - "joystick_move":
    x &amp; y will be values ranging between -1 &amp; 1, representing the current position of the
    joystick.
</div>
<br />While you're in your code, make sure you're not preventing the user from combining different
kinds of input simultaneously. A common mistake we've seen is for games to start ignoring gamepad
input when they see mouse &amp; KB, or vice versa.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="18"></a>Step 3.3 - On-screen Glyphs</h2>
To display an on-screen prompt for your controller, you need to get the physical origins that are
bound to an in-game action. The player may have bound more than one physical origin to the same
action, so it's best to have your UI cycle through displaying each origin.
<a
    href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamController#GetDigitalActionOrigins"
    class="bb_apilink"
    >ISteamController::GetDigitalActionOrigins</a
>
and
<a
    href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamController#GetAnalogActionOrigins"
    class="bb_apilink"
    >ISteamController::GetAnalogActionOrigins</a
>
will return the count of origins for the specified action, and fill out the passed in
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">originsOut</code> array.<br /><br />For each
origin, you can use the
<a
    href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamController#EControllerActionOrigin"
    class="bb_apilink"
    >ISteamController::EControllerActionOrigin</a
>
enum to remap the origin to a corresponding image. You may provide your own images for the
controller glyphs, but we generally recommend that you use the
<a
    href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamController#GetGlyphForActionOrigin"
    class="bb_apilink"
    >ISteamController::GetGlyphForActionOrigin</a
>
API call. When you call this function with an origin enum, it will return a local filepath to a .png
file for the corresponding controller glyph from Valve's official image set (located in the Steam
client's install folder).<br /><br />This method supports all hardware devices recognized by Steam
Input (so a PlayStation controller will show PlayStation buttons, and an Xbox controller will show
Xbox buttons, etc). Even better, it's future proof -- when Valve adds support for new hardware, this
function will automatically fetch updated glyphs without you needing to recompile your game with new
glyph assets. If you do decide to include your own custom glyph assets, you should at least check
for the case where your asset set does not have a matching glyph for the provided enum value, and
fall back to
<a
    href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamController#GetGlyphForActionOrigin"
    class="bb_apilink"
    >ISteamController::GetGlyphForActionOrigin</a
>. This way the glyph will always have something displayable and won't simply be blank.
<div class="bb_callout bb_green">
    <div>
        <h3>Poll continuously!</h3>
        Please note that the user can change their configuration at any time. To help with this,
        we've ensured the
        <a
            href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamController#GetDigitalActionOrigins"
            class="bb_apilink"
            >ISteamController::GetDigitalActionOrigins</a
        >
        and
        <a
            href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamController#GetAnalogActionOrigins"
            class="bb_apilink"
            >ISteamController::GetAnalogActionOrigins</a
        >
        functions are extremely cheap to call. <br /><br />When you display an onscreen prompt,
        don't cache the origins and keep displaying the first results. Instead, we recommend you
        re-gather the origins each frame, and display the matching prompts. That way, if a user
        decides to change their configuration as a result of seeing the prompt, when they return
        from the configuration screen the prompts will automatically update to match the new
        origins.
    </div>
</div>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="publishing"></a>Step 4 - Publishing</h2>
<br />Once your game is working with the controller, you're ready to publish. You'll need to release
your new game update and make your configuration the official one. Official configurations are
automatically loaded when a player launches your game for the first time. This allows users to
simply fire up your game and play without needing to go into the configuration screen at all.<br /><br />Here's
the recommended process:
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="19"></a>Step 4.1 - Update your game</h2>
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>Update your Steam depot with your new version of the game</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="20"></a>Step 4.2 - Publish your configuration</h2>
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        Run Steam in Big Picture mode and navigate to the default configuration you created in the
        controller configuration.<br />
    </li>
    <li>Hit the (Y) button, or click the "Save As" button at the bottom of the screen.<br /></li>
    <li>
        Select the desired localized title &amp; description in the popup, change it to a PUBLIC
        profile, and click the PUBLISH button.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        You will get a confirmation, and the file ID of the public configuration. Copy/save the ID.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="21"></a>Step 4.3 - Make the configuration official</h2>
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>Open up your game's page on the steam partner website.<br /></li>
    <li>
        Select "Steam Input" from the "Application" tab.<br /><br /><img
            src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/steamworks_steam_input.png"
            alt="steamworks_steam_input.png"
            title="steamworks_steam_input.png"
        /><br /><br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Scroll to the section called "Steam Input Template". Select the "Custom Configuration"
        option in the dropdown. (If you were not planning on adding native support and just want to
        select from common legacy mode presets, here is where you would do so).<br /><br /><img
            src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/steamworks_steam_input_custom_config.png"
            alt="steamworks_steam_input_custom_config.png"
            title="steamworks_steam_input_custom_config.png"
        /><br /><br />And from the selection below, select "Add Custom Configuration."<br /><br /><img
            src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/steamworks_steam_controller_custom2.png"
            alt="steamworks_steam_controller_custom2.png"
            title="steamworks_steam_controller_custom2.png"
        /><br /><br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Paste the file ID of your public configuration into the box, and click the OK button.<br /><br /><img
            src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/steamworks_steam_controller_custom3.png"
            alt="steamworks_steam_controller_custom3.png"
            title="steamworks_steam_controller_custom3.png"
        /><br /><br />
    </li>
    <li>Publish your app changes in the partner site as usual.</li>
</ul>
<br />If you'd like, you can also specify multiple official configurations for your game. You may
want to create an official "Southpaw" (left-handed) mode, for example.<br /><br />To do this, simply
create multiple configurations and publish them each via step 4.2. Then, in step 4.3, paste all the
file IDs for your configurations into the box, separated by the comma character (,) characters. The
first one on the list will be considered the highest priority, and will be picked by default for new
players. Don't forget to make
<a
    href="https://partner.steamgames.com/documentation/steamcontroller#step12"
    target="_blank"
    rel="noreferrer"
    >Titles &amp; Descriptions</a
>
for each of them. <br /><br />When your official configurations have been posted they will appear in
the "Custom Configuration" section:<br /><br /><img
    src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/steamworks_steam_input_branch_settings.png"
    alt="steamworks_steam_input_branch_settings.png"
    title="steamworks_steam_input_branch_settings.png"
/><br /><br />For each configuration you can get a direct link, see what controller type it is for,
control which beta branches it is available on, or remove it entirely. If you create a new official
configuration, you can use the remove / add functions in this section to replace an existing one.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="22"></a>Opting Controllers into Steam Input</h2>
<br />Next, you should setup what kind of controllers use Steam Input - if you are using Steam Input
API you'll want to make sure to check the "Any Future Devices" option to make sure new controllers
work by default without you having to adjust settings after support ships in Steam.<br /><br /><img
    src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/steamworks_steam_input_optin_settings.png"
    alt="steamworks_steam_input_optin_settings.png"
    title="steamworks_steam_input_optin_settings.png"
/><br /><br />Checking these boxes will cause those controller types to make use of Steam Input
rather than their standard gamepad input protocols.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="23"></a>Updating your official configurations</h2>
There are two ways to update your configuration. <br />
<ol class="bb_ol">
    <li>
        To make a breaking change such as adding/removing a new action set or adding actions that
        must be bound upload a new configuration for each supported controller type and remove the
        old configuration. You should also go into the Steam Input Configuration browser with the
        account that created the configuration and mark it deleted by hitting:<br /><br /><img
            src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/steamworks_remove_community_config.png"
            alt="steamworks_remove_community_config.png"
            title="steamworks_remove_community_config.png"
        /><br />
    </li>
    <li>
        To make an optional change such as adding a new language for your action name localization
        or adding a new optional action that does not need to be bound in every configuration,
        upload a single new configuration and use the "Use Action Block" checkbox to make sure the
        action block of that configuration is used preferentially on the selected branches.<br /><br /><img
            src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/steamworks_steam_input_use_action_block.png"
            alt="steamworks_steam_input_use_action_block.png"
            title="steamworks_steam_input_use_action_block.png"
        />
    </li>
</ol>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="24"></a>Tips</h2>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="25"></a>Dedicated Menu Actions</h2>
We recommend creating a separate in-game action set for your menu controls, instead of just re-using
actions in your main game set. Most customers won't need to modify this menu controls set, but it's
an easy way to provide the capability to players who actually need it (as can be the case for some
disabled gamers, for example).
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="26"></a>Custom Icons</h2>
The Steam Input system can also create several styles of on-screen menus. Putting your own .png
icons in <strong>&lt;your base game directory&gt;/TouchMenuIcons/*.png</strong> will show them first
in the list for your game's touch/radial menus. This will allow you to set up your own on-screen
radial menus or touch menus with icons bound to specific actions without doing any game/UI code. As
a developer you may wish to do this even if you don’t actually have any radial or touch menus in
your own default configuration. Since any user modified configurations will also have access to
these, users will be able to create nicely themed menus using your official icon art.<br />
