<h1>Getting Started for Developers</h1>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Overview</h2>
<br />
The Steam Input API is designed to allow you to easily enable <i>full support</i> for Steam Input
devices in your game. We define full support as the follows:<br />
<br />
<ul>
    <li>
        Your game uses the proper controller-specific glyphs when showing in-game input prompts.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        The Steam Input configurator screen uses in-game actions that the player performs in your
        game, instead of keys or buttons.<br />
    </li>
    <li>You've published an official configuration for the controllers you support.<br /></li>
    <li>
        Your game doesn't restrict the user's ability to customize their controls. This means it
        allows any mix of mouse, keyboard, or gamepad input simultaneously.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        When your game wants keyboard input (e.g. when naming avatars), you
        <a href="/doc/features/steam_controller/getting_started_for_devs#6">use the API</a> to
        automatically bring up the text entry UI.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Your game has no launchers that require mouse or KB input - or even better, no launcher at
        all.
    </li>
</ul>
<br />
To ensure users have a good experience from the couch, we also recommend the following:<br />
<br />
<ul>
    <li>
        Make your UI readable from several feet away. Our rule of thumb: when your game is running
        at 1920x1080, your fonts should be a minimum of 24px in size.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Start your game in fullscreen by default when the user is running Steam Big Picture (the
        "SteamTenfoot" environment variable will be set)<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        For bonus points, at first launch detect the user's screen resolution and set your
        resolution to match it.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="2"></a>Common Use Cases</h2>
<h2 class="bb_subsection">
    <a name="3"></a>I'm Adding Steam Input API support <i>before</i> shipping my game
</h2>
<br />
Great! Follow the technical directions in
<a href="/doc/features/steam_controller/getting_started_for_devs#implement_steam_input"
    >Implementing Steam Input API support</a
>.
<h2 class="bb_subsection">
    <a name="4"></a>I'm Adding Steam Input API support alongside other input libraries
</h2>
<br />
It's perfectly acceptable to ship conventional gamepad input as well as Steam Input, and if you're
adding Steam Input API support after initial launch or shipping your game on multiple platforms, you
could easily find yourself in this situation. There's a few things to keep in mind:<br />
<br />
<strong> 1. Be deliberate with your analog action choices</strong><br />
We'll be going into further detail on this topic later but the quick summary is:<br />
<ul>
    <li>
        You should always include a mouse-style action for cursor or precision camera controls. It
        may be acceptable to skip mouse-like input in Twin Stick or Sports titles where the joystick
        position is used for directional aim. <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Avoid using the the system mouse ("os_mouse" option) unless you have a good reason to need
        it. Being able to determine if input comes from a real mouse vs a controller is an important
        part of good UX practices.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        You should <i>either</i> rely on the configurator to provide sensitivity (ie you don't
        filter incoming Steam Input data), <i>or</i> you should use a dedicated sensitivity option
        for Steam Input that's distinct from the system mouse.
    </li>
</ul>
<br />
<strong> 2. Be consistent with auto-aim on joysticks </strong><br />
If you have any auto-aim or aim-assist applied to XInput analog sticks, consider applying that to
Steam Input devices as well, at least for traditional controller models configured through Steam
Input. You can call
<a href="/doc/api/ISteamInput#GetInputTypeForHandle">GetInputTypeForHandle</a> to determine an
individual controller's model type or implement separate mouse-style and joystick-style camera
actions.<br />
<br />
<strong> 3. Use SDL version 2.0.8 or above, if possible</strong><br />
If you're using <a href="https://www.libsdl.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">SDL</a> (Simple
DirectMedia Layer), one of the most popular cross-platform game libraries for handling things like
input, make sure you're using the latest version, or at least version 2.0.8 or above. This version
allows Steam to tell SDL to ignore input for controllers configured by Steam Input, which avoids
double-input bugs.<br />
<br />
<strong> 4. Have a plan for Xbox controllers </strong><br />
If your game has already shipped and has XInput support that you're leaving in place, you may want
to leave Xbox controllers in the XInput path by default. If you're a local multiplayer game you'll
want to make sure that you can either accept input from both paths at the same time or opt all
controller into Steam Input though.
<h2 class="bb_subsection">
    <a name="5"></a>I Want my Non-Steam Input API Games to Play Nicely with Steam Input
</h2>
<br />
First of all, I highly recommend reading Zach Burke's
<a
    href="https://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/ZachBurke/20151030/257920/The_5_Golden_Rules_of_Input.php"
    target="_blank"
    rel="noreferrer"
    >The Five Golden Rules of Input</a
>.<br />
<br />
To summarize, they are:<br />
<br />
<ol>
    <li><strong>On-screen icons should match the input device</strong><br /></li>
    <li><strong>Mouse cursor should match the input device</strong><br /></li>
    <li><strong>All devices should work 100% of the time</strong><br /></li>
    <li><strong>Dpad, analog stick, and mouse can all be used to navigate menus</strong><br /></li>
    <li><strong>A disconnected gamepad should pause the game</strong></li>
</ol>
<br />
These are good general guidelines to follow if you are able. To add our own emphasis:<br />
<br />
<strong> Gamepad and mouse input should be possible simultaneously </strong><br />
<br />
Most games allow mouse input, or gamepad input, but not both at the same time, and this is the chief
cause of compatibility issues with the Steam Input system. <br />
<br />
Additionally:<br />
<br />
<ol>
    <li>
        <strong>Set a recommended controller configuration for all controller types</strong><br />
        This way Steam doesn't have to prompt the user to select a configuration on startup. By the
        way, you don't need to provide a configuration for both the Xbox 360 and the Xbox One
        controllers -- if you only supply one, it will work for the other model.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Opt-in Controller Type you don't have native support for to Steam Input</strong
        ><br />
        If you don't have built-in support for these controller types, you should use the partner
        site to opt them in to using Steam Input. See the bottom of
        <a href="/doc/features/steam_controller/getting_started_for_devs#21">this section</a> for
        more on that.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>If you're not going to allow simultaneous gamepad/mouse...</strong><br />
        ...at least make the deadzone, acceleration, and sensitivity of the joystick configurable.
        Joystick emulation for the trackpad works by rapidly flicking the virtual joystick so it is
        quite sensitive to these settings. For good results you want to allow very high
        sensitivities, deadzones that go to 0 and a linear acceleration curve.

        <strong
            >Allow users to select from Xbox or PS4 glyphs via the menu or detect the device type
            via our API</strong
        ><br />
        When Steam is sending gamepad input it will appear in your game as regular Xbox controller
        input, rather than the normal device. This is useful since it allows the player to use
        devices that would not normally work, but it also means that normal check for USB device
        ID's, etc will not work and you'll need to call a helper function from Steam. It's important
        to note here that even controllers which you have built-in support may appear in your game
        through Steam Input either because the user is streaming the game via Steam Remote Play or
        because the user has opted into Steam Input to reconfigure their devices.

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="6"></a>Text Input</h2>
<br />
On-screen text input is not technically part of the <a href="/doc/api/ISteamInput">ISteamInput</a>,
but is found instead in <a href="/doc/api/ISteamUtils">ISteamUtils</a>.<br />

You might find these useful regardless of whether you're using Steam Input in any way.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="implement_steam_input"></a>Implementing Steam Input API support</h2>
<br />
The implementation process is straightforward, and shouldn't take more than a few days of work. Four
steps are involved:<br />
<br />
<ol>
    <li>
        In a text editor, create an in-game actions file, which tells Steam what in-game actions
        your players can bind to the controller.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        In Steam, use the Steam Input configurator UI to create your default configuration.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        In your game, use the Steam Input API to read actions from the controller, and to retrieve
        appropriate glyphs for display.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Update your game depot with the new binaries, and publish your configuration as the official
        config.
    </li>
</ol>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="iga"></a>Step 1 - Creating an In-Game Actions File</h2>
<br />
Start by downloading the starting
<a
    href="https://cdn.steamstatic.com/steam/partner/controller/game_actions_X.vdf"
    target="_blank"
    rel="noreferrer"
    >in-game actions (IGA) file</a
>. Place it in your <i>"&lt;Steam Install Directory&gt;\controller_config"</i> directory (create the
directory if it doesn't exist). Rename the file to the following: <i>"game_actions_X.vdf"</i>, where
X is your game's Steam AppID. If you don't know what your game's Steam AppID is, it can be found by
logging into your Steam partner site.<br />
<br />
Now open up the file in your favorite text editor. The file is in a standard Valve format called
KeyValues, which is a simple &amp; easily read format. You might also find it useful to download one
of our <a href="/doc/features/steam_controller/iga_examples">In-Game Actions File Templates</a> or
the
<a
    href="https://cdn.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/portal2_actions.vdf"
    target="_blank"
    rel="noreferrer"
    >Portal 2 IGA</a
>
for a reference.<br />
<br />
For more details see: <a href="/doc/features/steam_controller/iga_file">In-Game Actions File</a>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="7"></a>File Format</h2>
<br />
IGA files contain an "actions" section, which should list all the in-game action sets (IGAS) in your
game. An IGAS describes all the actions a player can take within some game context - such as when
the player is in a vehicle, or on foot, or navigating the menu system. For each IGAS, the Steam
Input configuration UI will provide a tab that allows a player to customize how those actions are
bound to the controller.<br />
<br />
An IGAS entry in the IGA file should contain a "title" key &amp; value, and the following
subsections: "StickPadGyro", "AnalogTrigger", and "Button". The "StickPadGyro" and "AnalogTrigger"
sections each contain a list of IGAs that the player can only assign to the stick/pad/gyro and
analog triggers respectively. The "Buttons" section contains IGAs that can only be bound to digital
inputs (like the physical ABXY buttons, or a trackpad that's in ABXY mode, or a trigger that's not
being used as an AnalogTrigger action).
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="8"></a>Designing your IGA</h2>
Take a minute to think about the functionality of your game - how many distinct modes does it
contain? For each place where you want to have distinct controls you'll want to make an action set.
Most games will have at least a distinct "Menu" and "In-game" action set, but many will need more.
Does your game have any special cases like operating a vehicle or have specialized in-game menus
like a map or inventory screen, those may also be useful to make into action sets.<br />
<br />
Not everything needs to be a distinct action set though, you can also use action set layers to
handle similar modes. For example if you can drive both a car and boat in your game you may want to
include one "vehicle" action set with an action set layer of "boat" or "car" on top of it. Action
set layers retain any settings of the parent action set and can make understanding and editing
configurations more manageable for both your development team and your users.<br />
<br />
For more information on action set layers see:
<a href="/doc/features/steam_controller/action_set_layers">Action set layers</a>
<div class="bb_callout bb_red">
    <div>
        <h3><strong>Limits on the number of actions </strong></h3>
        Currently the maximum number of actions is 16 analog and 128 digital actions. It is very
        important to note that actions can be shared between action sets so in most cases you will
        only need a fraction of the maximum number of actions. This limit is not set in stone so if
        you've got a good reason for needing more, please let us know.
    </div>
</div>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="9"></a>Button Actions</h2>
<br />
The format for "Button" actions is as follows: <br />
<br />
<div class="bb_code">"&lt;action name&gt;" "#&lt;localization key&gt;"</div>
<br />
The <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">&lt;action name&gt;</code> is the internal name
you want to refer to this action by in your game code, when talking to the Steam Input API. The
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">&lt;localization key&gt;</code> should be the name
of an entry in your localization section (see Adding Localization). Make sure to include the '#'
character at the start of your localization key.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="10"></a>Analog Trigger Actions</h2>
<br />
The format for "AnalogTrigger" actions is the same as for "Button". "AnalogTrigger" actions should
be actions that your game will be interpreting as full analog inputs, like vehicle acceleration. If
you don't have any of that kind of input, just leave the section empty. The Steam Input configurator
UI will allow players to assign any "Button" action to the physical triggers if they're not being
used as an "AnalogTrigger" action.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="11"></a>StickPadGyro Actions</h2>
<br />
The format for "StickPadGyro" actions is as follows: <br />
<br />
<div class="bb_code">
    "&lt;action name&gt;" { "title" "#&lt;localization key&gt;" "input_mode" "&lt;analog mode&gt;" }
</div>
<br />
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">&lt;action name&gt;</code> and
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">&lt;localization key&gt;</code> are the same as the
matching keys in the "Button" format.
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">&lt;analog mode&gt;</code> tells us how to
interpret the data coming from the physical controls, before we pass it to your game via the steam
input API.<br />
<br />
Valid <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">&lt;analog modes&gt;</code> are as
follows:<br />
<br />
<ul>
    <li>
        <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">"absolute_mouse"</code> - for when you're
        expecting the action to behave like a mouse. Useful for first or third person camera, or an
        actual mouse cursor.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">"joystick_move"</code> - for when you're
        using the action to move a character around.
    </li>
</ul>
<div class="bb_callout bb_red">
    <div>
        <h3><strong>"absolute_mouse"</strong> vs. <strong>"joystick_move"</strong></h3>
        We can’t stress enough that when creating a camera input for your first/third person game or
        anything cursor driven, you should always include an <strong>"absolute_mouse"</strong> type
        action and react to deltas as if it’s a mouse as the 1:1 data is required for implementing
        good quality Gyro aim or trackpad input. Steam Input is able to convert joystick input from
        gamepads into "absolute_mouse" style input for you but due to the acceleration curves and
        deadzones applied in-game it's not possible to convert the other direction. <br />
        <br />
        It's fine to include a <strong>"joystick_move"</strong> style action if you want exact
        parity for joystick aim with your console builds but please test that you can accept input
        from both <strong>"absolute_mouse"</strong> and <strong>"joystick_move"</strong> at the same
        time so Playstation and Switch controllers can use Gyro aim along side the joystick. You may
        also want to implement a digital action for "Reset Camera" to re-center the vertical
        position of the camera. If you have auto aim enabled for XInput controllers please apply the
        same logic to joystick input through Steam Input API and consider applying a lighter amount
        of auto aim for trackpad/gyro aim.
    </div>
</div>
<br />
There is one optional setting for StickPadGyro actions that are using
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">"absolute_mouse"</code> as their input. If you set
the <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">"os_mouse"</code> key to
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">"1"</code>, we'll pass the input from the player
into the OS as well as your game. This is useful if you have a visible OS mouse cursor that should
be controlled by this action. <br />
<br />
Here's an example: <br />
<br />
<div class="bb_code">
    "menu_mouse" { "title" "#Menu_Mouse_Title" "input_mode" "absolute_mouse" "os_mouse" "1" }
</div>
<div class="bb_callout bb_red">
    <div>
        <h3>Warning</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                We <strong>strongly discourage</strong> using the "os_mouse" option for
                <strong>camera controls</strong>. If specific parts of your game are hard to patch,
                remember that you can always have separate analog actions that are used only in the
                menu vs. the in-game action sets.<br />
            </li>
            <li>
                Using "os_mouse" will cause your controller inputs to be controlled by the in-game
                mouse sensitivities and will only work for a single local player.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </div>
</div>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="12"></a>Step 1.1 - Adding Localization</h2>
<br />
The "localization" section in your IGA file contains a list of languages, each of which is a section
containing localization keys &amp; values. For example: <br />
<br />
<div class="bb_code">
    "localization" { "english" { "Action_Jump" "Jump" "Action_Camera" "Camera" } "german" {
    "Action_Jump" "Springen" "Action_Camera" "Kameraansicht" } }
</div>
<br />
The actions in your IGA file should then specify their names by referring to the desired
localization key, preceded by the '#' character. Here are example actions using the above
localization keys:<br />
<br />
<div class="bb_code">
    "StickPadGyro" { "Camera" { "title" "#Action_Camera" "input_mode" "absolute_mouse" } } "Button"
    { "Jump" "#Action_Jump" }
</div>
<br />
If the language the game is running under is not found in the localization section, English will be
used as a fallback. If English is not found, the string will be shown as is. For details on
supported languages, please see
<a href="/doc/store/localization/languages">Fully supported languages</a>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="13"></a>Step 1.2 - Titles &amp; Descriptions</h2>
<br />
Configurations also need a localized title and description. If you're only making a single official
configuration for your game, you don't need to worry about this - we'll provide a default title and
description, and you can skip this step entirely. But if you want to have multiple official
configurations for your game, then you'll also need to provide localized titles and descriptions for
them.<br />
<br />
Configuration titles and descriptions should be listed along with the rest of your localization
keys. The title key must start with
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">"Title_"</code>, and the description key must start
with <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">"Description_"</code>. Here's an example:
<br />
<br />
<div class="bb_code">
    "localization" { "english" { "Title_Config1" "Official Configuration" "Description_Config1"
    "This config was created by the developers of Game X." "Title_Config2" "Official Southpaw
    Configuration" "Description_Config2" "This config was created by the developers of Game X, and
    is setup for Southpaw users." "Action_Jump" "Jump" "Action_Camera" "Camera" } }
</div>
<br />
When you publish a configuration (see <a href="#publishing">Step 4 - Publishing</a>), you'll be able
to select which of these localized titles and descriptions you want to use.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="14"></a>Step 2 - Creating a Default Configuration</h2>
<br />
Once you've created your IGA file, and ensured it's in the right directory &amp; named to match your
game's AppID, you're ready to create a configuration. <br />
<br />
Run Steam in Big Picture mode, and navigate to your game's game details page. <br />
<br />
Select "Manage Game," and then "Configure Controller." If you receive any errors at this point,
they'll be identifying issues in your IGA file and you'll need to go fix them - the most common
mistake is a missing closing quote or brace.<br />
<br />
If you don't receive any errors, you're now looking at an empty controller configuration for your
game, and it should be fully aware of your in-game actions. Use the UI to create a default
configuration. Make sure you set defaults for all your in-game action sets, not just the first
one.<br />
<br />
Once you've got a configuration, save it privately. Don't publish it, because your game is not yet
ready to receive IGAs.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="15"></a>Step 3 - The Steam Input API</h2>
<br />
Make sure you have the latest version of the Steamworks API - Grab it from the
<a href="/documentation/getting_started" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
    >Getting Started With SteamWorks</a
>
page.<br />
<br />
Steam Input provides per-app mappings for controllers to decide which mapping to run and Steam will
track the foreground window. This can make it trickier to debug the controller while you're working
on it, because the controller will change its configuration when you hit a breakpoint in your
debugger. There are two ways to make Steam lock onto your window for debugging, either run the
following Steam URL:<br />
<div class="bb_code">
    steam://forceinputappid/&lt;your_game's_AppID or 0 to reset to normal operation&gt;
</div>
<br />
or add the following command line parameters to your Steam shortcut: <br />
<div class="bb_code">-forcecontrollerappid &lt;your_game's_AppID</div>
<div class="bb_callout bb_red">
    <div>
        <h3>NOTE:</h3>
        By "Steam shortcut" we mean a shortcut to the Steam client itself. The command line
        parameters need to be passed to the Steam client, not your game.
    </div>
</div>

<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="16"></a>Step 3.1 - API Overview</h2>
<br />
The Steam Input API is built around the in-game actions &amp; sets that you specified in your
in-game actions file in Step 1. <br />
<br />
For a complete API reference, see <a href="/doc/api/ISteamInput">ISteamInput Interface</a><br />
<br />
The functionality overview is as follows: <br />
<br />
<ul>
    <li>
        On game startup, initialize Steam Input with
        <a href="/doc/api/ISteamInput#Init">ISteamInput::Init</a>, use the
        <a href="/doc/api/ISteamInput#GetActionSetHandle">ISteamInput::GetActionSetHandle</a>,
        <a href="/doc/api/ISteamInput#GetDigitalActionHandle">ISteamInput::GetDigitalActionHandle</a
        >, and
        <a href="/doc/api/ISteamInput#GetAnalogActionHandle">ISteamInput::GetAnalogActionHandle</a>
        functions to resolve the action &amp; set names into handles. Use these handles to identify
        actions &amp; sets throughout the rest of the API.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Use
        <a href="/doc/api/ISteamInput#GetConnectedControllers"
            >ISteamInput::GetConnectedControllers</a
        >
        to detect when a controller exists. Use the handles it returns to identify controllers
        throughout the rest of the API.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Use <a href="/doc/api/ISteamInput#ActivateActionSet">ISteamInput::ActivateActionSet</a> /
        <a href="/doc/api/ISteamInput#DeactivateActionSet">ISteamInput::DeactivateActionSet</a> to
        control which controllers are bound to different action sets, and if you're using
        <a href="/doc/features/steam_controller/action_set_layers">action set layers</a>, use
        <a href="/doc/api/ISteamInput#ActivateActionSetLayer"
            >ISteamInput::ActivateActionSetLayer</a
        >
        /
        <a href="/doc/api/ISteamInput#DeactivateActionSetLayer"
            >ISteamInput::DeactivateActionSetLayer</a
        >.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Use
        <a href="/doc/api/ISteamInput#GetDigitalActionData">ISteamInput::GetDigitalActionData</a>
        and
        <a href="/doc/api/ISteamInput#GetAnalogActionData">ISteamInput::GetAnalogActionData</a> to
        read the input state of all your in-game actions. You may call
        <a href="/doc/api/ISteamInput#RunFrame">ISteamInput::RunFrame</a> right before to get the
        freshest data or you may rely on calling SteamAPI_RunCallbacks elsewhere in your game.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Use
        <a href="/doc/api/ISteamInput#GetDigitalActionOrigins"
            >ISteamInput::GetDigitalActionOrigins</a
        >
        and
        <a href="/doc/api/ISteamInput#GetAnalogActionOrigins"
            >ISteamInput::GetAnalogActionOrigins</a
        >
        to get the origin(s) that the player has assigned to your in-game actions, and show the
        appropriate glyphs in your onscreen UI.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Use <a href="/doc/api/ISteamInput#ShowBindingPanel">ISteamInput::ShowBindingPanel</a> to pop
        up the Steam overlay directly into the controller configuration for a specified controller.
        This means you won't need to make a customization UI.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Use
        <a href="/doc/api/ISteamInput#GetInputTypeForHandle">ISteamInput::GetInputTypeForHandle</a>
        if you want to identify each controller's device model so you can use matching art in game.
        This is useful for e.g. player seat selection screens as seen in couch co-op games, sports
        games, etc.
    </li>
</ul>
<div class="bb_callout bb_red">
    <div>
        <h3>Safe Interfaces</h3>
        Controller data is gathered when
        <a href="/doc/api/ISteamInput#RunFrame">ISteamInput::RunFrame</a> is called. This is
        normally done for you every frame by
        <a href="/doc/api/steam_api#SteamAPI_RunCallbacks">SteamAPI_RunCallbacks</a>. However, if
        you have version-safe interfaces enabled and find you're not getting good polling data you
        will need to call <a href="/doc/api/ISteamInput#RunFrame">ISteamInput::RunFrame</a> every
        frame.<br />
        <br />
        You can tell if you have version-safe interfaces enabled by seeing if you have this #define
        in your code:<br />
        <div class="bb_code">VERSION_SAFE_STEAM_API_INTERFACES</div>
    </div>
</div>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="17"></a>Step 3.2 - Input Handling</h2>
<br />
For digital actions, the data returned by
<a href="/doc/api/ISteamInput#GetDigitalActionData">ISteamInput::GetDigitalActionData</a> is
straightforward:<br />
<br />
<div class="bb_code html">
    bState: will be true if the action is being sent by the controller (button is pressed, trigger
    pulled, etc)
</div>
<br />
For analog actions, the data returned by
<a href="/doc/api/ISteamInput#GetAnalogActionData">ISteamInput::GetAnalogActionData</a> is only
slightly more complex:<br />
<br />
<div class="bb_code html">
    x,y: will depend on the mode you assigned the game action to in your IGA File. -
    "absolute_mouse": x &amp; y will be deltas from the previous mouse position. - "joystick_move":
    x &amp; y will be values ranging between -1 &amp; 1, representing the current position of the
    joystick.
</div>
<br />
While you're in your code, make sure you're not preventing the user from combining different kinds
of input simultaneously. A common mistake we've seen is for games to start ignoring gamepad input
when they see mouse &amp; KB, or vice versa.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="18"></a>Step 3.3 - On-screen Glyphs</h2>
To display an on-screen prompt for your controller, you need to get the physical origins that are
bound to an in-game action. The player may have bound more than one physical origin to the same
action, so it's best to have your UI cycle through displaying each origin.
<a href="/doc/api/ISteamInput#GetDigitalActionOrigins">ISteamInput::GetDigitalActionOrigins</a> and
<a href="/doc/api/ISteamInput#GetAnalogActionOrigins">ISteamInput::GetAnalogActionOrigins</a> will
return the count of origins for the specified action, and fill out the passed in
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">originsOut</code> array.<br />
<br />
For each origin, you can use the
<a href="/doc/api/ISteamInput#EControllerActionOrigin">ISteamInput::EControllerActionOrigin</a> enum
to remap the origin to a corresponding image. When you call this function with an origin enum, it
will return a local filepath to a .png or .svg file for the corresponding controller glyph from
Valve's official image set (located in the Steam client's install folder). This method supports all
hardware devices recognized by Steam Input (so a PlayStation controller will show PlayStation
buttons, and an Xbox controller will show Xbox buttons, etc). Even better, it's future proof -- when
Valve adds support for new hardware, this function will automatically fetch updated glyphs without
you needing to recompile your game with new glyph assets. <br />
<br />
You may provide your own images for the controller glyphs, but we strongly recommend making sure to
do some future-proofing as Steam Input is always adding support for new devices and the only thing
stopping them from working well with your game is if glyph images are broken or blank. You can
either:<br />
<ul>
    <li>
        fall back to the image returned by
        <a href="/doc/api/ISteamInput#GetGlyphForActionOrigin"
            >ISteamInput::GetGlyphForActionOrigin</a
        >
        when you don't recognize an action origin<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        call
        <a href="/doc/api/ISteamInput#TranslateActionOrigin">ISteamInput::TranslateActionOrigin</a>
        to get the closest equivalent glyph that existed when the version of the Steamworks SDK
        existed, ex: PS6 Cross Button translated into PS5 Cross Button
    </li>
</ul>
<div class="bb_callout bb_green">
    <div>
        <h3>Poll continuously!</h3>
        Please note that the user can change their configuration at any time. To help with this,
        we've ensured the
        <a href="/doc/api/ISteamInput#GetDigitalActionOrigins"
            >ISteamInput::GetDigitalActionOrigins</a
        >
        and
        <a href="/doc/api/ISteamInput#GetAnalogActionOrigins"
            >ISteamInput::GetAnalogActionOrigins</a
        >
        functions are extremely cheap to call. <br />
        <br />
        When you display an onscreen prompt, don't cache the origins and keep displaying the first
        results. Instead, we recommend you re-gather the origins each frame, and display the
        matching prompts. That way, if a user decides to change their configuration as a result of
        seeing the prompt, when they return from the configuration screen the prompts will
        automatically update to match the new origins.
    </div>
</div>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="publishing"></a>Step 4 - Publishing</h2>
<br />
Once your game is working with the controller, you're ready to publish. You'll need to release your
new game update and make your configuration the official one. Official configurations are
automatically loaded when a player launches your game for the first time. This allows users to
simply fire up your game and play without needing to go into the configuration screen at all.<br />
<br />
Here's the recommended process:
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="19"></a>Step 4.1 - Update your game</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Update your Steam depot with your new version of the game</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="20"></a>Step 4.2 - Publish your configuration</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        Run Steam in Big Picture mode and navigate to the default configuration you created in the
        controller configuration.<br />
    </li>
    <li>Hit the (Y) button, or click the "Save As" button at the bottom of the screen.<br /></li>
    <li>
        Select the desired localized title &amp; description in the popup, change it to a PUBLIC
        profile, and click the PUBLISH button.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        You will get a confirmation, and the file ID of the public configuration. Copy/save the ID.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="21"></a>Step 4.3 - Make the configuration official</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Open up your game's page on the Steamworks partner website.<br /></li>
    <li>
        Select "Steam Input" from the "Application" tab.<br />
        <br />
        <img
            src="https://cdn.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/steamworks_steam_input.png"
            alt="steamworks_steam_input.png"
            title="steamworks_steam_input.png"
        /><br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Scroll to the section called "Steam Input Template". Select the "Custom Configuration"
        option in the dropdown. (If you were not planning on adding native support and just want to
        select from common legacy mode presets, here is where you would do so).<br />
        <br />
        <img
            src="https://cdn.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/steamworks_steam_input_custom_config.png"
            alt="steamworks_steam_input_custom_config.png"
            title="steamworks_steam_input_custom_config.png"
        /><br />
        <br />
        And from the selection below, select "Add Custom Configuration."<br />
        <br />
        <img
            src="https://cdn.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/steamworks_steam_controller_custom2.png"
            alt="steamworks_steam_controller_custom2.png"
            title="steamworks_steam_controller_custom2.png"
        /><br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Paste the file ID of your public configuration into the box, and click the OK button.<br />
        <br />
        <img
            src="https://cdn.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/steamworks_steam_controller_custom3.png"
            alt="steamworks_steam_controller_custom3.png"
            title="steamworks_steam_controller_custom3.png"
        /><br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>Publish your app changes in the partner site as usual.</li>
</ul>
<br />
If you'd like, you can also specify multiple official configurations for your game. You may want to
create an official "Southpaw" (left-handed) mode, for example.<br />
<br />
To do this, simply create multiple configurations and publish them each via step 4.2. Then, in step
4.3, paste all the file IDs for your configurations into the box, separated by the comma character
(,) characters. The first one on the list will be considered the highest priority, and will be
picked by default for new players. Don't forget to make
<a href="/documentation/steamcontroller#step12" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
    >Titles &amp; Descriptions</a
>
for each of them. <br />
<br />
When your official configurations have been posted they will appear in the "Custom Configuration"
section:<br />
<br />
<img
    src="https://cdn.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/steamworks_steam_input_branch_settings.png"
    alt="steamworks_steam_input_branch_settings.png"
    title="steamworks_steam_input_branch_settings.png"
/><br />
<br />
For each configuration you can get a direct link, see what controller type it is for, control which
beta branches it is available on, or remove it entirely. If you create a new official configuration,
you can use the remove / add functions in this section to replace an existing one.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="22"></a>Opting Controllers into Steam Input</h2>
<br />
Next, you should set up what kind of controllers use Steam Input - if you are using Steam Input API
you'll want to make sure to check the "Any Future Devices" option to make sure new controllers work
by default without you having to adjust settings after support ships in Steam.<br />
<br />
<img
    src="https://cdn.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/steamworks_steam_input_optin_settings.png"
    alt="steamworks_steam_input_optin_settings.png"
    title="steamworks_steam_input_optin_settings.png"
/><br />
<br />
Checking these boxes will cause those controller types to make use of Steam Input rather than their
standard gamepad input protocols.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="23"></a>Updating your official configurations</h2>
There are two ways to update your configuration. <br />
<ol>
    <li>
        To make a breaking change such as adding/removing a new action set or adding actions that
        must be bound upload a new configuration for each supported controller type and remove the
        old configuration. You should also go into the Steam Input Configuration browser with the
        account that created the configuration and mark it deleted by hitting:<br />
        <br />
        <img
            src="https://cdn.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/steamworks_remove_community_config.png"
            alt="steamworks_remove_community_config.png"
            title="steamworks_remove_community_config.png"
        /><br />
    </li>
    <li>
        To make an optional change such as adding a new language for your action name localization
        or adding a new optional action that does not need to be bound in every configuration,
        upload a single new configuration and use the "Use Action Block" checkbox to make sure the
        action block of that configuration is used preferentially on the selected branches.<br />
        <br />
        <img
            src="https://cdn.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/steamworks_steam_input_use_action_block.png"
            alt="steamworks_steam_input_use_action_block.png"
            title="steamworks_steam_input_use_action_block.png"
        />
    </li>
</ol>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="24"></a>Tips</h2>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="25"></a>Dedicated Menu Actions</h2>
We recommend creating a separate in-game action set for your menu controls, instead of just re-using
actions in your main game set. Most customers won't need to modify this menu controls set, but it's
an easy way to provide the capability to players who actually need it (as can be the case for some
disabled gamers, for example).
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="26"></a>Custom Icons</h2>
The Steam Input system can also create several styles of on-screen menus. Putting your own .png
icons in <strong>&lt;your base game directory&gt;/TouchMenuIcons/*.png</strong> will show them first
in the list for your game's touch/radial menus. This will allow you to set up your own on-screen
radial menus or touch menus with icons bound to specific actions without doing any game/UI code. As
a developer you may wish to do this even if you don’t actually have any radial or touch menus in
your own default configuration. Since any user modified configurations will also have access to
these, users will be able to create nicely themed menus using your official icon art.<br />
