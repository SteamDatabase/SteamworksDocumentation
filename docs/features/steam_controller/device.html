<h1>Steam Input Devices</h1>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="SupportedDevices"></a>Overview</h2>
<br />
This section documents all of the devices officially supported by the steam input configurator, with
detailed descriptions of their physical differences and capabilities. Developers should familiarize
themselves with all of these devices since the player base uses the full range of devices.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="ListDevices"></a>Supported Devices</h2>
<br />
As of this writing, there are six supported device categories, with more to come in the future.<br />
<br />
<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="/doc/features/steam_controller/device/steam_controller">Steam Controller</a><br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="/doc/features/steam_controller/device/ps4_controller">Playstation 4 Controller</a
        ><br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="/doc/features/steam_controller/device/x360_controller">Xbox 360 Controller</a
        ><br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="/doc/features/steam_controller/device/xb1_controller">Xbox One Controller</a><br />
    </li>
    <li>Any generic XInput Controller<br /></li>
    <li>Any DirectInput gamepad</li>
</ul>
<br />
Note that the terms "PlayStation 4 controller", "Xbox 360 controller", and "Xbox one controller"
also refer to any variant devices (such as fighting game joysticks) that use the same input protocol
as the base model.<br />
