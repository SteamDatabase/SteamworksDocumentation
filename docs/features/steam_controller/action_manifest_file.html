<h1>Action Manifest Files</h1>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Overview</h2>
In addition to using the Steam Workshop for hosting configurations, game can also choose to bundle
their configurations directly with the game depots. There's a number of benefits to bundling
configuration in your game depots:<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        Official configurations can be checked into Perforce or other revision control tools<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Managing configurations between different branches of your game or between a public and
        private AppID is easier<br />
    </li>
    <li>Updates are atomic rather than being done via two publishing steps in Steamworks</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="2"></a>Format</h2>
The action manifest file is an extension of the
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/features/steam_controller/iga_file" class="bb_doclink"
    >In-Game Actions File</a
>
which includes an extra section containing a list of official configurations broken out by type:<br />
<div class="bb_code">
    "Action Manifest" { "configurations" { } "actions" { } "localization" { } }
</div>
For information about the action and localization sections please see the
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/features/steam_controller/iga_file" class="bb_doclink"
    >In-Game Actions File</a
>
documentation.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="3"></a>Configuration List</h2>
In the controller configuration section the configurations are listed by controller type, then by
priority for loading. The "path" value is listed relative to the Action Manifest file's location
on-disk.<br />
<div class="bb_code">
    "Action Manifest" { "configurations" { "controller_xboxone" { "0" { "path" "xbox_controller.vdf"
    } } "controller_steamcontroller_gordon" { "0" { "path" "steam_controller.vdf" } "1" { "path"
    "steam_controller_motion_controls.vdf" } } } "actions" { } "localization" { } }
</div>
<br />Supported controller type strings:<br /><br />

        <td>Steam Deck Controller</td>
        <td>controller_neptune</td>

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="4"></a>Setting up an Action Manifest File</h2>
There are two main ways to setup your action manifest file, either starting from scratch or using an
existing IGA file.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="5"></a>Starting with an In-Game Actions file</h2>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="6"></a>Step 1 - Save a configuration</h2>
If you have an existing IGA file you can save your current configuration out by going to the
controller configuration screen-&gt;Export-&gt;"Save Personal Binding". If you've setup multiple
localization tokens for titles/descriptions you'll be given a dropdown of options to pick from.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="7"></a>Step 2 - Find your configuration</h2>
Next you will run the following Steam URL to dump the configuration into your OS-specific documents
folder, ex: My Documents on Windows. URL:<br /><br />Windows Commandline <br />
<div class="bb_code">start steam://dumpcontrollerconfig?appid=X</div>
Linux Commandline<br />
<div class="bb_code">xdg-open steam://dumpcontrollerconfig?appid=X</div>
<br />Copy both the configuration and your existing IGA file into the desired location inside the
game folder.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="8"></a>Step 3 - Convert the IGA file to Action Manifest file</h2>
To convert your IGA file to an Action Manifest edit the file and add a "configuration" section
including a listing for the controller configuration you just exported. This is an example from the
Steamworks SDK:<br />
<div class="bb_code">
    "configurations" { "controller_xboxone" { "0" { "path" "xbox_controller.vdf" } }
    "controller_steamcontroller_gordon" { "0" { "path" "steam_controller.vdf" } } }
</div>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="9"></a>Step 4 - Set the Steamworks settings</h2>
To set your Steamworks settings in the partner site, navigate to the Steam Input settings. Next set
the dropdown to "Custom Configuration (Bundled with game)" and enter the path where the action
manifest is located:<br /><br /><img

/>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="10"></a>Debugging a game that uses an Action Manifest File</h2>
When running the game through Steam the Action Manifest file will automatically be pulled from your
game depots. If you're running via the IDE and have the game installed Steam will also use the
Action Manifest file from your Steam depots. However if you're running without the game installed in
Steam or have local changes you need to make then you can override the Action Manifest path with the
SetInputActionManfiestPath API call. This override will be remembered for the rest of the Steam
session. There's an example of it's use in the Steamworks SDK:<br />
<div class="bb_code">
    char rgchCWD[1024]; if ( !_getcwd( rgchCWD, sizeof( rgchCWD ) ) ) { strcpy( rgchCWD, "." ); }
    char rgchFullPath[1024]; #if defined(_WIN32) _snprintf( rgchFullPath, sizeof( rgchFullPath ),
    "%s\\%s", rgchCWD, "steam_input_manifest.vdf" ); #elif defined(OSX) _snprintf( rgchFullPath,
    sizeof( rgchFullPath ), "%s/steamworksexample.app/Contents/Resources/%s", rgchCWD,
    "steam_input_manifest.vdf" ); #else _snprintf( rgchFullPath, sizeof( rgchFullPath ), "%s/%s",
    rgchCWD, "steam_input_manifest.vdf" ); #endif SteamInput()-&gt;SetInputActionManifestFilePath(
    rgchFullPath );
</div>
