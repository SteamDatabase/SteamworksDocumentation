<h1>Input Source Modes</h1>
Input sources can have different modes imposed on them that change how they
behave. These are called "input source modes." Although these are useful for
digital inputs, the most frequent place you'll find yourself using Input Source
Modes is on analog controls, especially with touchpads, which can be configured
in many different ways.<br /><br />This section provides a detailed breakdown of
the different kinds of input source modes known to the configurator, see
<a
  href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/features/steam_controller/concepts#input_source_modes"
  class="bb_doclink"
  >Input Source Modes</a
>
in the General Concepts page for a high-level overview.<br /><br />Each input
source has different capabilities for <strong>native</strong> mode (available in
games that have exposed actions via the Steam Input API), as well as
<strong>legacy</strong> mode (everything else). Note that Legacy mode bindings
are also available in games with native API support and can be mixed and matched
with native action bindings -- you'll just have to click the "advanced" button
in certain sections to enable it.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Dpad</h2>
<br />This input will act as a D-pad. D-Pad's are a 4 way directional input that
is digital (on or off) in nature. <br /><br /><strong>Legacy note</strong>: Any
type of button can be assigned, but X-Input buttons will only work with X-Input
Gamepad compatible games.

      Most games apply their own deadzones to controller output. If the control
      feels 'mushy' with a physical area of movement where no output is seen in
      game, it is likely caused by the game's deadzone. You can remove this
      using the Anti-Deadzone setting. This subtracts away the deadzone, and
      provides finer grain control within the remaining section. The higher the
      slider, the more is added to the smallest output value. Note that if all
      deadzone is removed entirely, all positions will cause input. You can use
      Anti-DeadZone Buffer to allow for a small area where no input will be
      sent, even if the anti-deadzone is larger than the deadzone of the game.

    <td>
      If an anti-deadzone has been applied, there may be no remaining actual
      deadzone as applied by the game, so touching anywhere will actively cause
      movement. To allow for a safe buffer area where no input will be sent, the
      anti-deadzone buffer acts as the new deadzone for the control. It can be
      visualized as a radius from the center of the pad, within which no input
      will be sent.

      If set, the binding will be sent when inside the radius instead of
      outside. For example, 'Walk' or 'Sneak' could be sent when inside a
      certain zone.

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="27"></a>Radial Menu</h2>
<br />This input will act as a Radial Menu. Radial Menus display on-screen when
your finger touches the Touch Pad. Clicking on one of the shown buttons will
fire off the appropriate action. RadialMenus can have a variety of buttons,
layouts, size, opacity, and can use icons.

      The interaction with the radial menu can work in a few different ways.
      Click actions require the pad or stick to be clicked to use. If set to
      touch release/modeshift end, the action will be sent when it stops
      receiving input or if it's on a modeshift, when that modeshift ends.
      \"Always\" will always send the button so long as the option is
      highlighted.
