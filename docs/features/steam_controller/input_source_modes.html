<h1>Input Source Modes</h1>
Input sources can have different modes imposed on them that change how they behave. These are called
"input source modes." Although these are useful for digital inputs, the most frequent place you'll
find yourself using Input Source Modes is on analog controls, especially with touchpads, which can
be configured in many different ways.<br />
<br />
This section provides a detailed breakdown of the different kinds of input source modes known to the
configurator, see
<a href="/doc/features/steam_controller/concepts#input_source_modes">Input Source Modes</a> in the
General Concepts page for a high-level overview.<br />
<br />
Each input source has different capabilities for <strong>native</strong> mode (available in games
that have exposed actions via the Steam Input API), as well as <strong>legacy</strong> mode
(everything else). Note that Legacy mode bindings are also available in games with native API
support and can be mixed and matched with native action bindings -- you'll just have to click the
"advanced" button in certain sections to enable it.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Dpad</h2>
<br />
This input will act as a D-pad. D-Pad's are a 4 way directional input that is digital (on or off) in
nature. <br />
<br />
<strong>Legacy note</strong>: Any type of button can be assigned, but XInput buttons will only work
with XInput Gamepad compatible games.

                movement will be lower than horizontal, while more will increase the ratio to more
                vertical movement.

                Most games apply their own deadzones to controller output. If the control feels
                'mushy' with a physical area of movement where no output is seen in game, it is
                likely caused by the game's deadzone. You can remove this using the Anti-Deadzone
                setting. This subtracts away the deadzone, and provides finer grain control within
                the remaining section. The higher the slider, the more is added to the smallest
                output value. Note that if all deadzone is removed entirely, all positions will
                cause input. You can use Anti-DeadZone Buffer to allow for a small area where no
                input will be sent, even if the anti-deadzone is larger than the deadzone of the
                game.

                If an anti-deadzone has been applied, there may be no remaining actual deadzone as
                applied by the game, so touching anywhere will actively cause movement. To allow for
                a safe buffer area where no input will be sent, the anti-deadzone buffer acts as the
                new deadzone for the control. It can be visualized as a radius from the center of
                the pad, within which no input will be sent.

This input feels like a mouse, but outputs a joystick. This is intended for games which do not allow
simultaneous mouse and gamepad inputs. It's the next best option to the real thing for providing an
emulated 1:1 response.
<div class="bb_callout bb_green">
    <div>
        <strong>NOTE:</strong> Since this mode is seen by the game as a joystick, the sensitivity
        response is limited by the game's gamepad sensitivity settings. For best results, set the
        in-game gamepad camera sensitivity to the highest value possible.

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="24"></a>Mouse Region</h2>

This input will act as a Mouse Region. Mouse Region sends mouse input to a game, but treats the pad
as a 1:1 map to screen space, so touching a particular place on the pad will always put the cursor
in the same place on the screen. In addition to working great for top-down style games, regions can
be restricted to certain areas of the screen, scaled, stretched and mode-shifted in to select
mini-maps, toolbars, inventory, etc.

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="27"></a>Radial Menu</h2>
<br />
This input will act as a Radial Menu. Radial Menus display on-screen when your finger touches the
Touch Pad. Clicking on one of the shown buttons will fire off the appropriate action. Radial Menus
can have a variety of buttons, layouts, size, opacity, and can use icons.

                The interaction with the radial menu can work in a few different ways. Click actions
                require the pad or stick to be clicked to use. If set to touch release/modeshift
                end, the action will be sent when it stops receiving input or if it's on a
                modeshift, when that modeshift ends. \"Always\" will always send the button so long
                as the option is highlighted.
