<h1>Legacy Mode Bindings</h1>
"Legacy mode" bindings are always available for any game. Even games that support native Steam Input
actions still allow the player to mix in legacy mode bindings in the configurator.<br />
<br />
Through legacy mode, you can rebind any input on your controller to any emulated system input --
mouse, keyboard, or gamepad (ie, XInput events).<br />
<br />
The legacy mode binding screen looks like this:<br />

    title="legacy_mode.png"
/><br />
<br />
To apply an emulated input, simply click on the appropriate input.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="1"></a>Mouse</h2>
Available bindings include left, middle, and right mouse buttons, mousewheel up, mousewheel down,
and two auxiliary mouse buttons (4 and 5).
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="2"></a>Keyboard</h2>
Available bindings are all the keys on a standard keyboard. Note that the inputs here are sent by
scancode, so although the display here is a standard USA English keyboard, the input that is
actually sent depends on your system language/keyboard layout. So inputs like "WASD" on the
configurator layout will actually map to whatever keys are in the corresponding positions in your
system layout.

        <h3>Non-standard keyboard layouts</h3>
        There are some known issues with this if you are using a layout other than the default one
        for your language -- e.g. Dvorak or Colemak for English. There can also be issues if the
        default layout for your language doesn't match what we expect (there are some known issues
        where the Polish one doesn't match the layout most games expect). In this case you must
        either fix the keyboard bindings in game, or in the configuration.

<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="3"></a>Gamepad</h2>
All the typical gamepad buttons in the XInput standard (those that typically appear on an Xbox 360 /
Xbox One controller) are available here.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="4"></a>Special inputs</h2>
<br />
In addition to emulating mouse, keyboard, and gamepad input, there are also a row of special
bindings at the top:<br />

<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="5"></a>Change Action Set/Layer</h2>
<br />
<img
    src="https://cdn.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/legacy_action_set.png"
    alt="legacy_action_set.png"
    title="legacy_action_set.png"
/><br />
<br />
This lets you activate Action Sets or
<a href="/doc/features/steam_controller/action_set_layers">Action Set Layers</a> that you have
defined yourself. This is useful for games that have various different "modes" that you might want
different control bindings for, such as "walking" vs "driving" vs "flying", etc.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="6"></a>Show Virtual Keyboard</h2>
<br />

    alt="legacy_show_keyboard.png"
    title="legacy_show_keyboard.png"
/><br />
<br />
This brings up the on-screen virtual keyboard via the Steam overlay.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="7"></a>Take Screenshot</h2>
<br />
<img

    alt="legacy_screenshot.png"
    title="legacy_screenshot.png"
/><br />
<br />
This takes a screenshot.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="8"></a>Select Cursor Position</h2>
<br />

    alt="legacy_select_cursor_position.png"
    title="legacy_select_cursor_position.png"
/><br />
<br />
This lets you generate a mouse click on a specific screen position as its own binding. For instance,
if you need to click a particular button on a game's GUI that doesn't have an exposed hotkey of any
sort. This is particularly useful in games like
<a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/239030/Papers_Please/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
    >Papers, Please</a
>
and Hearthstone -- check out this player's
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYKfnWtQSaQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">video</a> as
an example.
<div class="bb_callout bb_red">
    <div>
        <h3>Warning</h3>
        Although Steam Input re-scales the mouse position proportionally with resolution, many games
        do not apply consistent proportional scaling to their GUI elements. This means that a cursor
        position binding that works in one resolution on a given game might not work in a different
        resolution because all the elements have moved around in unexpected ways.

<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="9"></a>Toggle Magnifier</h2>
<br />

    alt="legacy_magnification.png"
    title="legacy_magnification.png"
/><br />
<br />
This toggles the operating system's magnification tool, zooming in on the current mouse position.
<br />
<br />
Currently the only operating systems that support the magnifier are Windows and Steam OS.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="10"></a>Power/System Options</h2>
<br />

<br />
Options include:<br />
<br />
<ul>
    <li><strong>TURN OFF CONTROLLER</strong><br /></li>
    <li><strong>OPEN BIG PICTURE</strong><br /></li>
    <li><strong>MINIMIZE BIG PICTURE</strong><br /></li>
    <li><strong>QUIT BIG PICTURE</strong><br /></li>
    <li><strong>SUSPEND HOST PC</strong><br /></li>

    alt="legacy_light.png"
    title="legacy_light.png"
/><br />
<br />
This lets you control how the controller's LED functions (if it has one). Only PS4 Controllers
support colored light options.<br />
<br />
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Default User Setting</strong><br />
        No change to how the light functions<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Default XInput Slot Number Setting</strong><br />
        Slots 1-4 are colored red, blue, green, and purple, respectively.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Custom Setting</strong><br />
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Controller Light Color</strong><br />

</ul>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="12"></a>Music</h2>

    title="legacy_music.png"
/><br />
<br />
This lets you control music playback from your Steam music player.<br />
<br />
Options include:<br />
<ul>
    <li><strong>STEAM MUSIC PLAY/PAUSE</strong><br /></li>
    <li><strong>STEAM MUSIC NEXT</strong><br /></li>
    <li><strong>STEAM MUSIC PREVIOUS</strong><br /></li>
    <li><strong>STEAM MUSIC VOLUME UP</strong><br /></li>
    <li><strong>STEAM MUSIC VOLUME DOWN</strong><br /></li>

<br />
This does nothing, and is used for clearing out a previously selected special action.
