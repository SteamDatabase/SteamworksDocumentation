<h1>Microsoft Xbox One Controller</h1>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="Overview"></a>Overview</h2>
<br />
The Xbox One controller, originally designed for Microsoft's Xbox One home game console, was the
second 3rd-party device to get official Steam Input support (simultaneous with the Xbox 360
controller and generic XInput devices). In contrast to the Playstation 4 Controller and Steam
Controller, it lacks both touchpad and gyroscope. A slight evolution of the Xbox 360 Controller, it
features identical input capabilities in a revised form factor.<br />

The physical inputs are identical to the
<a href="/doc/features/steam_controller/device/x360_controller">Xbox 360 Controller</a>, with a few
small cosmetic differences:<br />
<br />
<ul class="%1$s">
    <li>The face buttons have a darker color scheme<br /></li>
    <li>The DPAD has a more traditional form factor<br /></li>
    <li>The Xbox Guide button has a new design<br /></li>
    <li>
        The BACK and START buttons are now called VIEW and MENU and have new labels (two overlapping
        windows and a 3-line "hamburger menu"). These are identical in function to BACK and START on
        the Xbox 360 controller, they just have new names and icons.<br />
