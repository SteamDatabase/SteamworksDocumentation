<h1>Steam Controller</h1>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="Overview"></a>Overview</h2>
<br />
Formerly, many different parts of the Steam input system contained the words "Steam Controller", but
that got a little confusing. Now "Steam Controller" just means this particular input device.<br />

<br />
The Steam Controller is distinguished from standard XInput devices in several ways:<br />
<br />
<ul>
    <li>Two haptic trackpads<br /></li>
    <li>Two digital "grip" paddles on the back<br /></li>
    <li>An internal gyroscope<br /></li>
    <li>One analog joystick instead of two<br /></li>
    <li>Haptic pulses instead of traditional "rumble"</li>
</ul>
<br />
What follows is a detailed breakdown of its physical inputs.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="FaceButtons"></a>Face buttons</h2>
<strong>Digital</strong><br />
The A, B, X, and Y buttons follow the physical layout and coloring of the XInput standard seen in
devices like the Xbox 360 controller.<br />

<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="Joystick"></a>Joystick</h2>
<strong>Analog, 2 axes</strong> (+ digital "click")<br />
<br />
The analog joystick is essentially identical to a traditional controller's, including digital "click
the stick" functionality. The only difference is the steam controller only has one.<br />

<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="BackStart"></a>Back and Start</h2>
<strong>Digital</strong><br />
The Back and Start buttons are on either side of the Steam "home" button. Unlike the Steam "home"
button, they are not reserved by the system and can be freely used by games &amp; applications.<br />

<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="SteamHome"></a>Steam "home" button</h2>
<strong>Reserved</strong><br />
<br />
The central Steam "home" button is reserved by the system and can't be used by games &amp;
applications. Pressing this button during a game will invoke the Steam overlay.<br />

        <strong>NOTE</strong>: Invoking the Steam overlay will not pause your game! It is up to you
        to detect the overlay and pause your game yourself.

<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="ShoulderButtons"></a>Shoulder buttons</h2>
<strong>Digital</strong><br />
The shoulder buttons are pretty standard.<br />
<br />

/>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="ShoulderTriggers"></a>Shoulder triggers</h2>
<strong>Analog, 1 axis</strong> (+ digital "full pull")<br />
The analog triggers on the Steam Controller have a distinct digital "click" at the end of the normal
analog range distinguishing a "full pull" from a "soft pull", similar to the triggers on the
Nintendo GameCube controller.<br />
<br />

<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="HapticTrackpads"></a>Haptic Trackpads</h2>
<strong>Analog, 2 axes</strong> (+ digital "click")<br />
The haptic trackpads are perhaps the defining feature of the Steam Controller, as well as the most
versatile physical inputs on the device. They feature a high resolution touch surface with
programmable haptic feedback, as well as digital click functionality on each. These can be used to
generate direct analog motion with many different user settings, but they can also be made to
emulate other devices, such as mice, joysticks, trackballs, etc. Some of their most powerful
features come from using them in concert with the steam overlay to create on-screen radial menus and
touch menus (see
<a href="/doc/features/steam_controller/input_source_modes">Input Source Modes</a>). The left
touchpad features an embossed Dpad shape, but is otherwise entirely identical to the right touchpad
in terms of functionality.<br />

<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="Gyro"></a>Gyro</h2>
<strong>Analog, 3 axes</strong><br />
Last but not least, the Steam Controller features an internal gyroscope for motion sensing. The gyro
is fully able to detect all three axes of motion (pitch, yaw, and roll), and has been put to great
use as an aim device in first-person shooters, among other applications.<br />
