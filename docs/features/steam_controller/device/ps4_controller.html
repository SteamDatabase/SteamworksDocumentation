<h1>Sony PlayStation 4 Controller</h1>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="Overview"></a>Overview</h2>
<br />
The Sony PlayStation 4 controller* was the first third party device to get official Steam Input
support. It shares certain features with the Steam controller that are lacking in the XInput
standard (central trackpad &amp; gyroscope), while hewing to a more traditional twin-stick form
factor that some players prefer.<br />

<br />
The PlayStation 4 controller has all the same physical features available to XInput controllers, as
well as:<br />
<br />
<ul>
    <li>A central trackpad<br /></li>
    <li>An internal gyroscope<br /></li>
    <li>A programmable LED light bar</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="FaceButtons"></a>Face buttons</h2>
<strong>Digital</strong><br />
The PlayStation 4 controller features four standard face buttons labeled with a SQUARE, a CROSS, a
TRIANGLE, and a CIRCLE.<br />

        <strong>NOTE FOR DEVELOPERS</strong>: In the West, the "CROSS" button is typically used for
        "confirm" and the "CIRCLE" button for "back/cancel", but the convention in Japan is
        reversed. When publishing your official configurations you might consider making
        appropriately labeled Western and Japanese variants for the DUALSHOCK 4 Controller

<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="Joysticks"></a>Joysticks</h2>
<strong>Analog, 2 axes</strong> (+ digital "click")<br />
Like most other gamepads, the PlayStation 4 Controller features two analog joysticks, on the left
and right side. Unlike other controllers, they are not vertically offset. Like most modern
joysticks, the sticks themselves can be clicked in as additional digital buttons.<br />

<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="ShareAndOptions"></a>SHARE and OPTIONS</h2>
<strong>Digital</strong><br />
The SHARE and OPTIONS buttons are on either side of the central touchpad. Although the SHARE button
is reserved on the PS4 console, it is not on the PC when using the Steam Input configurator. Both
buttons can be freely used by games &amp; applications.<br />

        <strong>NOTE</strong>: SHARE and OPTIONS correspond to SELECT and START on previous
        PlayStation Controller models.

<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="L1R1"></a>L1 and R1 (Shoulder buttons)</h2>
<strong>Digital</strong><br />
The shoulder buttons are pretty standard.<br />
<br />

/>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="L2R2"></a>L2 and R2 (Shoulder triggers)</h2>
<strong>Analog, 1 axis (each)</strong><br />
Unlike the Steam controller, the L2 and R2 analog triggers on the PlayStation 4 controller do
<i>not</i> have a distinct digital "click" at the end of the normal analog range distinguishing a
"full pull" from a "soft pull". From a hardware perspective they are purely analog input devices.
However, the Steam Input configurator is able to fix this; the player may set a threshold that
distinguishes a "full pull" from a "soft pull."<br />

<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="DPAD"></a>Dpad</h2>
<strong>Digital</strong><br />
The PlayStation 4 controller features a fairly standard digital pad, or Dpad. Physically, this
counts as four separate digital buttons, but designed in such a way that makes it impossible to
press both buttons on the same axis at the same time.<br />
<br />

<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="TOUCHPAD"></a>Touchpad</h2>
<strong>Analog, 2 axes</strong><br />
<br />
The PlayStation 4 controller features a single large rectangular (non-haptic) trackpad on the top of
the device. It has a high resolution touch surface as well as a digital button underneath. The Steam
Input configurator is able to treat this as either two separate touch regions (dividing it into left
and right halves), or as one large unified touch surface. Any of these configurations can be used in
the same way as the Steam controller's trackpads, with the exception of haptic feedback.<br />

<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="GYRO"></a>Gyro sensor</h2>
<strong>Analog, 3 axes</strong><br />
<br />
Like the Steam controller, the PlayStation 4 controller also has a built-in gyro sensor with similar
functionality, and likewise has 3 axes of motion (pitch, yaw, and roll).<br />
