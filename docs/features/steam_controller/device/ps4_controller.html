<h1>Sony PlayStation 4 Controller</h1>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="Overview"></a>Overview</h2>
<br />The Playstation 4 Controller*, originally designed for Sony's PlayStation
4, was the first 3rd-party device to get official Steam Input support. It shares
certain features with the Steam Controller that are lacking in the XInput
standard (touchpad &amp; gyroscope), while hewing to a more traditional
twin-stick form factor that some players prefer.<br /><br />*<i
  >referring here to all compatible models, including but not limited to the
  DUALSHOCK 4 model</i

/><br /><br />The Playstation 4 Controller has all the same physical features
available to XInput controllers, as well as:<br /><br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
  <li>A central touchpad<br /></li>
  <li>An internal gyroscope<br /></li>
  <li>A programmable LED light bar</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="FaceButtons"></a>Face buttons</h2>
<strong>Digital</strong><br />The Playstation 4 Controller features four
standard face buttons labeled with a SQUARE, a CROSS, a TRIANGLE, and a
CIRCLE.<br /><br /><img

    <strong>NOTE FOR DEVELOPERS</strong>: In the West, the "CROSS" button is
    typically used for "confirm" and the "CIRCLE" button for "back/cancel", but
    the convention in Japan is reversed. When publishing your official
    configurations you might consider making appropriately labeled Western and
    Japanese variants for the DUALSHOCK 4 Controller

<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="Joysticks"></a>Joysticks</h2>
<strong>Analog, 2 axes</strong> (+ digital "click")<br />Like most other
gamepads, the Playstation 4 Controller features two analog joysticks, on the
left and right side. Unlike other controllers, they are not vertically offset.
Like most modern joysticks, the sticks themselves can be clicked in as
additional digital buttons.<br /><br /><img

<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="ShareAndOptions"></a>SHARE and OPTIONS</h2>
<strong>Digital</strong><br />The SHARE and OPTIONS buttons are on either side
of the central touchpad. Although the SHARE button is reserved on the PS4
console, it is not on the PC when using the Steam Input Configurator. Both
buttons can be freely used by games &amp; applications.<br /><br /><img

<div class="bb_callout bb_green bb_fixed">

    <strong>NOTE</strong>: SHARE and OPTIONS correspond to SELECT and START on
    previous PlayStation Controller models.

<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="L1R1"></a>L1 and R1 (Shoulder buttons)</h2>
<strong>Digital</strong><br />The shoulder buttons are pretty standard.<br /><br /><img

/>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="L2R2"></a>L2 and R2 (Shoulder triggers)</h2>
<strong>Analog, 1 axis (each)</strong><br />Unlike the Steam Controller, the L2
and R2 analog triggers on the DS4 Controller do <i>not</i> have a distinct
digital "click" at the end of the normal analog range distinguishing a "full
pull" from a "soft pull". From a hardware perspective they are purely analog
input devices. However, the Steam Input Configurator is able to fix this; the
player may set a threshold that distinguishes a "full pull" from a "soft
pull."<br /><br /><img

<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="DPAD"></a>Digital pad</h2>
<strong>Digital</strong><br />The Playstation 4 Controller features a fairly
standard digital pad, or DPAD. Physically this counts as four separate digital
buttons, but with a physical feature that makes it impossible to press both
buttons on the same axis at the same time.<br /><br /><img

<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="TOUCHPAD"></a>Touchpad</h2>
<strong>Analog, 2 axes</strong><br /><br />The Playstation 4 Controller features
a single large rectangular (non-haptic) touchpad on the top of the device. It
has a high resolution touch surface as well as digital click functionality. The
Steam Input Configurator is able to treat this as either two separate touch
regions (dividing it into left and right halves), or as one large unified touch
surface. Any of these configurations can be used in the same way as the Steam
Controller's touchpads, with the exception of haptic feedback.<br /><br /><img

<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="GYRO"></a>Gyro sensor</h2>
<strong>Analog, 3 axes</strong><br /><br />Like the Steam Controller, the
Playstation 4 Controller also has a built-in gyro sensor with similar
functionality, and likewise has 3 axes of motion (pitch, yaw, and roll).<br /><br /><img
