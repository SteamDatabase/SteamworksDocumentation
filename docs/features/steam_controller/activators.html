<h1>Activators</h1>
Activators are a powerful tool for controlling how, when, and how often an input responds to you.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Example: Repeat "Down" on Hold</h2>
<br />Have you ever played, say, a menu-driven RPG and gotten frustrated that you had to repeatedly
push "down" to scroll through a list of hundreds of items, one at a time?<br /><br />Activators let
you define simple macros like, "If I hold DOWN for 1 second, repeat DOWN every 0.1 seconds
thereafter until release." Ta-da! Now you can scroll through that list in a jiffy just by holding
down the button, even though the developers never implemented it!<br /><br />So here we are in the
configuration menu for said hypothetical RPG -- the DPAD is already properly bound, but we want to
add an activator to the "Dpad Down" input:<br /><br /><img

    alt="activator_ddown.png"
    title="activator_ddown.png"
/><br /><br />Selecting that, we see this menu, and select "Show Activators."<br /><br /><img
    src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/show_activators.png"
    alt="show_activators.png"
    title="show_activators.png"
/><br /><br />From here we are taken to the activators menu and have a variety of settings at our
disposal:<br /><br /><img
    src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/activator_menu.png"
    alt="activator_menu.png"
    title="activator_menu.png"
/><br /><br />So first thing's first -- let's select "Long Press" as our activation type. This is
what will trigger the special behavior.<br /><br /><img
    src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/activator_long_press.png"
    alt="activator_long_press.png"
    title="activator_long_press.png"
/><br /><br />By default, the activator's binding is set to the original input (Dpad Down), which
we'll leave because that's what we want. We'll also leave "Long Press Time" on the default value,
0.15 seconds.<br /><br />We will, however, set "Hold To Repeat (Turbo)" to "On":<br /><br /><img
    src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/activator_turbo.png"
    alt="activator_turbo.png"
    title="activator_turbo.png"
/><br /><br />We'll leave the "Repeat Rate" at it's default value, 0.9 seconds. Now, whenever Dpad
Down is pressed and held for longer then 0.15 seconds, every 0.9 seconds therafter it will pulse an
additional Dpad Down event until the input is released. These timings can of course be adjusted to
taste.<br /><br />If you want to add several different activators, you can do that by selecting "Add
Activator." You can remove an activator by selecting "None - Remove Activator" as the Activation
Type. There doesn't seem to be a limit to how many activators you can add, but any more than five
will start to run off of the interface.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="2"></a>Activator Settings</h2>
<br />Let's break down all the settings available in the Activator system. These settings are always
available regardless of activation type:<br /><br />
<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Name</th>
        <th>Values</th>
        <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Activation Type</td>
        <td>
            Regular Press, Double Press, Long Press, Start Press, Release Press, None - Remove
            Activator
        </td>
        <td>
            Activators determine how the input responds to you. Is it a regular press, a long press,
            a double tap? Select them here or remove them.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Binding</td>
        <td>Digital input/action</td>
        <td>
            You can bind one or more actions to this activator, such as keyboard, mouse, and gamepad
            buttons or native actions.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Toggle</td>
        <td>On, Off</td>
        <td>
            Toggle will make this activator continue to be active after releasing it until it is
            pressed again.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Fire Start Delay</td>
        <td>0.0-1.0</td>
        <td>
            The activator will wait for this period of time after the button has been pressed before
            activating. This delay will offset the entire period the button is held, so if no end
            delay is set, the total period of time the button is held will be the same, just
            delayed.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Fire End Delay</td>
        <td>0.0-1.0</td>
        <td>
            The activator will wait for this period of time after the button has been released
            before deactivating. The end delay will make a button be active for longer than it was
            physically held.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Haptics Intensity</td>
        <td>Off, Low, Medium, High</td>
        <td>
            This defines the strength of haptics on activation and deactivation of the activator.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Cycle Binding</td>
        <td>On, Off</td>
        <td>
            Cycle Bindings will make this activator cycle through each of its bindings in order each
            time it is activated. Order is determined by the order they were selected in the button
            binding process.
        </td>

<br />These settings are specific to certain activation types:<br /><br />
<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Name</th>
        <th>Values</th>
        <th>Activation Type</th>
        <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Interruptable</td>
        <td>Off, On</td>
        <td>Regular Press, Release Press</td>
        <td>
            Interruptable activators can be paused or stopped by other activators. For example, a
            Long Press activator can interrupt a Full Press activator so the Full Press only fires
            if the Long Press doesn't. If not interruptable, it ignores the other activator in
            regards to behavior.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Double Tap Time</td>
        <td>0.0-1.0</td>
        <td>Double Press</td>
        <td>
            Determines how fast you must double tap to activate the activator. Any interruptable
            activators also on this input will not fire until this time has passed.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Long Press Time</td>
        <td>0.0-1.0</td>
        <td>Long Press</td>
        <td>
            Determines how long you must hold the button to activate the activator. Any
            interruptable activators also on this input will not be activated until the button is
            released prior to this time and they will not be activated at all if the Long Press is
            activated.
        </td>

    <tr>
        <td>Hold to Repeat (Turbo)</td>
        <td>On, Off</td>
        <td>Regular Press, Double Press, Long Press</td>
        <td>
            Turbo will make this activator activate and deactivate at a rapid pace while held. Can
            be used in combination with cycle bindings.
