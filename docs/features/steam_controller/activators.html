<h1>Activators</h1>
Activators are a powerful tool for controlling how, when, and how often an input responds to you.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Example: Repeat "Down" on Hold</h2>
<br />
Have you ever played, say, a menu-driven RPG and gotten frustrated that you had to repeatedly push
"down" to scroll through a list of hundreds of items, one at a time?<br />
<br />
Activators let you define simple macros like, "If I hold DOWN for 1 second, repeat DOWN every 0.1
seconds thereafter until release." Ta-da! Now you can scroll through that list in a jiffy just by
holding down the button, even though the developers never implemented it!<br />
<br />
So here we are in the configuration menu for said hypothetical RPG -- the Dpad is already properly
bound, but we want to add an activator to the "Dpad Down" input:<br />
<br />

    title="activator_ddown.png"
/><br />
<br />
Selecting that, we see this menu, and select "Show Activators."<br />
<br />

    alt="show_activators.png"
    title="show_activators.png"
/><br />
<br />
From here we are taken to the activators menu and have a variety of settings at our disposal:<br />
<br />

    alt="activator_menu.png"
    title="activator_menu.png"
/><br />
<br />
So first thing's first -- let's select "Long Press" as our activation type. This is what will
trigger the special behavior.<br />
<br />
<img
    src="https://cdn.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/activator_long_press.png"
    alt="activator_long_press.png"
    title="activator_long_press.png"
/><br />
<br />
By default, the activator's binding is set to the original input (Dpad Down), which we'll leave
because that's what we want. We'll also leave "Long Press Time" on the default value, 0.15
seconds.<br />
<br />
We will, however, set "Hold To Repeat (Turbo)" to "On":<br />
<br />
<img
    src="https://cdn.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/activator_turbo.png"
    alt="activator_turbo.png"
    title="activator_turbo.png"
/><br />
<br />
We'll leave the "Repeat Rate" at it's default value, 0.9 seconds. Now, whenever Dpad down is pressed
and held for longer than 0.15 seconds, every 0.9 seconds therafter it will pulse an additional Dpad
down event until the input is released. These timings can of course be adjusted to taste.<br />
<br />
If you want to add several different activators, you can do that by selecting "Add Activator." You
can remove an activator by selecting "None - Remove Activator" as the activation type. There doesn't
seem to be a limit to how many activators you can add, but any more than five will start to run off
of the interface.

Let's break down all the settings available in the activator system. These settings are always
available regardless of activation type:<br />

                Activators determine how the input responds to you. Is it a regular press, a long
                press, a double tap? Select them here or remove them.

            <td>
                Toggle will make this activator continue to be active after releasing it until it is
                pressed again.

            <td>0.0-1.0</td>
            <td>
                The activator will wait for this period of time after the button has been pressed
                before activating. This delay will offset the entire period the button is held, so
                if no end delay is set, the total period of time the button is held will be the
                same, just delayed.
            </td>

            <td>Fire End Delay</td>
            <td>0.0-1.0</td>
            <td>
                The activator will wait for this period of time after the button has been released
                before deactivating. The end delay will make a button be active for longer than it
                was physically held.

                Cycle bindings will make this activator cycle through each of its bindings in order
                each time it is activated. Order is determined by the order they were selected in
                the button binding process.

Here's a description of the various activation types:<br />

        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Regular Press</td>
            <td>
                Regular Press Activator is the default type. When you press the button, it activates
                and stays on until you release it.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Double Press</td>
            <td>
                Double Press Activator requires a quick double tap of the input to activate. If held
                on the second press, it will remain pressed. Any interruptable activators on the
                same button will not fire if a double press is fired, and will be paused until the
                double press time has passed.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Long Press</td>
            <td>
                Long Press Activator requires the button to be held for a period of time to
                activate. Once the long press time has passed, it will stay active until you release
                it. Any interruptable activators on the same button will not fire if a long press is
                fired, and will be paused until the button is released while under the long press
                time.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Start Press</td>
            <td>
                Start Press Activator activates when the button is pressed. It immediately
                deactivates even if the button continues to be held. This is useful, particularly
                when used with a Release Press Activator, to convert a Toggle into a Hold, such as a
                Toggle Crouch action.

        <tr>
            <td>Chorded Press</td>
            <td>
                Like the regular press, but additionally, a specific button must be held down at the
                same time that the regular activation input is pressed. Other bindings for the
                chorded button will continue to fire.

        </tr>
        <tr>

            <td>Selecting this option will remove the activator and any bindings it contains.</td>

            <td>
                Interruptable activators can be paused or stopped by other activators. For example,
                a long press activator can interrupt a full press activator so the full press only
                fires if the long press doesn't. If not interruptable, it ignores the other
                activator in regards to behavior.

                Determines how fast you must double tap to activate the activator. Any interruptable
                activators also on this input will not fire until this time has passed.

                Determines how long you must hold the button to activate the activator. Any
                interruptable activators also on this input will not be activated until the button
                is released prior to this time and they will not be activated at all if the Long
                Press is activated.
