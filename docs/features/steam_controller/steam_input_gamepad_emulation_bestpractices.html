<h1>Steam Input Gamepad Emulation - Best Practices</h1>
Steam Input is a service allowing Steam users to play any controller-supported game with the device
of their choice. Steam Input will translates the user's input into something the game understands
through either Gamepad Emulation, Mouse and Keyboard Emulation, or Steam Input API. Here we will
focus on how to best use Steam Input Gamepad Emulation to extend your game's existing controller
support.<br /><br />What's Gamepad Emulation?<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        On Windows the Steam Overlay will hook traditional gamepad input APIs such as Xinput,
        DirectInput, RawInput, and Windows.Gaming.Input and inject an emulated Xbox controller
        device. On macOS and Linux emulated controller input is provided by a driver.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        The controller will show up in your game as an Xbox controller which means that controllers
        with extra inputs will have some of them duplicated, ex: PlayStation trackpad click and the
        options button both mapping to Xinput's Start button.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        In addition to normal gamepad input it's possible to bind Switch, PlayStation, and Steam
        Controller gyro inputs to mouse emulation and provide motion controls. This only works in
        games with a single local player because there is only one mouse input and also relies on
        the game accepting simultaneous mouse and gamepad input. If you're interested in these
        features without those caveats please consider adding

            class="bb_doclink"
            >Steam Input API</a
        ><br />
    </li>
    <li>
        You can query the type of controller currently from Steam in order to show device specific
        glyphs but you are limited to the types supported by your current Steamworks SDK. If you're
        interested in future-proof glyph support please integrate
        <a
            href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/features/steam_controller/getting_started_for_devs"
            class="bb_doclink"
            >Steam Input API</a
        ><br />
    </li>
    <li>
        You may have users playing via Steam Input even for controllers you already support because
        Steam Remote Play uses it to provide input while streaming and a sizable portion of users
        have also enabled Steam Input for reconfiguring their controllers across the Steam library.
        Overall roughly a quarter of all controller sessions on Steam in 2020 used Steam Input,
        including nearly half of all PlayStation controller sessions.
    </li>
</ul>
<br />Over 2000 games on Steam use Gamepad Emulation for at least one controller type, including
notable games such as Monster Hunter: World, Ace Combat 7, Dragon Quest XI, Into the Breach, and
Middle Earth: Shadow of War though not all of them are following the full list of best practices.
Here we'll highlight Into the Breach because they are doing a great job of following each of these
best practices.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Showing device specific art</h2>
We support a few ways to get device specific glyphs with Steam Input Gamepad Emulation – one for
games that can load images at run-time that is future-proofed (meaning that when Steam updates Steam
Input it will work without any game updates) and two for games which need to bake the images into
their assets or want to use the same stylized art from the console ports of their game. Into the
Breach uses their own art for Xbox/Steam Controllers:<br /><br /><img

/>
<div class="bb_callout bb_green">
    <div>
        Note: Even when using your own art we suggest you fallback to Steam's art when you don't
        recognize a controller or call our helper function to find the closest option that existed
        when your game was released so when future devices are added they have reasonable glyphs.

<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="5"></a>Using RawInput For Device Detection</h2>
Some games will use RawInput to support more than 4 controllers or will use it to determine if they
have Playstation controllers connected. This API will also return other non-gamepad devices and
doesn't have a reliable index to directly map from Steam Input functions. Instead you can get this
info by querying RIDI_DEVICENAME string from GetRawInputDeviceInfo() which is encoded with the USB
VID/PID of real device, gamepad index, and Steam Input handle with the following format:<br />\\.\pipe\HID#VID_045E&amp;PID_028E&amp;IG_00#{Real
device VID}&amp;{Real Device PID}&amp;{Steam Input API handle}#{Steam Input Gamepad
Index}}#{ProcessID}<br />For example,
\\.\pipe\HID#VID_045E&amp;PID_028E&amp;IG_00#045E&amp;0B00&amp;00045EB00704DAF3#0#20160 for an Xbox
one controller with a VID/PID of 0x45e/0x0b00.<br /><br />Example code:<br />
<div class="bb_code">
    #define VALVE_DIRECTINPUT_GAMEPAD_VID 0x28DE #define VALVE_DIRECTINPUT_GAMEPAD_PID 0x11FF

</div>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="6"></a>Setting the Steamworks Settings</h2>
The first step is to setup which controllers will use Steam Input in the Opt-in section on the
Steamworks settings under Application-&gt;Steam Input. For a standard game w/ Xbox controller
support we recommend checking all checkboxes other than Xbox:<br /><br /><img
    src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/steamworks_steam_input_optin_settings.png"
    alt="steamworks_steam_input_optin_settings.png"
    title="steamworks_steam_input_optin_settings.png"
/><br /><br />If your game has flight stick or racing wheel support you'll want to uncheck the box
for Generic/DirectInput controllers because Steam doesn't support remapping those devices.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="7"></a>Selecting a configuration</h2>
You can choose to create your own configuration or pick from one of our premade templates. It is not
necessary to create your own configuration unless you plan tweaking the configurations away from our
defaults or labeling individual bindings with what they do in-game. The built-in templates for Steam
Input are localized into all Steam's languages so please make sure you also localize your
configuration to avoid English being shown to non-English users.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="8"></a>Picking a template</h2>
Console controllers do not differentiate between the various gamepad template variants, but these
settings are important for the Steam Controller. Here's an explanation of the templates and which
type of games they are intended for:<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        <strong>Gamepad</strong> - This emulates an Xbox controller with the right trackpad being
        turned into a raw emulated joystick. Perfect for twin-stick, platformer, or sports games.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Gamepad With High Precision Camera/Aim</strong> - This configuration is the ideal
        configuration for an FPS or any game using camera controls. Be careful to test that your
        game supports simultaneous gamepad/mouse before selecting this, including any ancillary
        screens such as inventory or map screens.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Gamepad with Camera Controls</strong> - This configuration takes mouse-style input
        from the trackpad and translates it into flicks of an emulated joystick. If your game can be
        configured to have very high joystick sensitivity, no deadzone, and a linear acceleration
        curve this configuration can work well, otherwise please consider using a mouse/keyboard
        config instead.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="9"></a>Creating a custom configuration</h2>
Configurations can be auto-converted between most controller types, but you'll at a minimum want to
make a Steam Controller and Xbox controller configuration.
<div class="bb_callout bb_green">
    <div>
        Note: if you plan on taking advantage of device specific features like motion controls
        you'll want to also have one for PlayStation 4 or Nintendo Switch controllers.

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="10"></a>Text Input</h2>
<br />On-screen text input is not technically part of the

(Steam Input), but is found instead in
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamUtils" class="bb_apilink">ISteamUtils</a>.
This is currently only implemented when the player launches the game through Big Picture Mode.<br /><br />Some

<br /><strong>Localizing your configuration</strong><br />Making a localized configuration is a
little bit more complicated when not using Steam Input API but it is still achievable.<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        To start make sure you have not edited your configuration since the last time it was
        exported. Open the configurator and make an edit (it is ok to make, then revert a
        change).<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Go to your Steam\Logs\controller_ui.txt log and look for a string like this:<br />
