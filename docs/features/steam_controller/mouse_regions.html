<h1>Mouse Regions</h1>
Certain inputs can be mapped to "mouse regions", which send mouse input to the game, but map the
input's total range of movement 1:1 with screen space, which means e.g. that touching a specific
location on, say, a touch pad, will always put the cursor at the same place on the screen. In
addition to working great for top-down style games, regions can be restricted to certain areas of
the screen, scaled, stretched and mode-shifted in to select mini-maps, toolbars, inventory, etc.<br />
<br />
For example, you can use this in legacy mode for games that require precision clicking on UI
elements in fixed locations.<br />
<br />
Note that mouse regions do not fire any actions or mouse events automatically, by default they just
control the mouse position. If you want to additionally fire actions or mouse events you must
specifically apply those bindings in your configuration.

This game features tactical turn-based combat, and on this particular screen there is a HUD element
in the lower left that lets you select different characters. By placing an oval-shaped mouse region
in the lower left hand corner and binding it to the Steam controller trackpad, we can easily select
a character just by swiping left or right and clicking.<br />

<i>Empires of the Undergrowth</i><br />

<br />
This is an insect-themed Real-Time Strategy game. Here the lower left hand corner features a
minimap, so placing a mouse region in that area will allow us to scroll around and quickly direct
our attention where it's needed.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="2"></a>Visible mouse regions</h2>
<br />
If you select "Toggle Controller HUD" from the Big Picture Mode overlay, you'll see an on-screen
indication of your mouse region, which is useful for setting it up the first time.<br />

<br />
The shape of the mouse region depends on the controller and input. For example, the PS4 controller
has a rectangular trackpad, which creates a rectangular mouse region, whereas the Steam controller
has a circular trackpad, which creates circular mouse regions.<br />

Here's what the mouse region configuration screen looks like:<br />

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="3"></a>Basic Settings</h2>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="4"></a>Region Size</h2>
<br />
This will scale the size of the region that is mapped to the outer extents of the pad/stick. You can
set any value between 0.0 and 1.0, and the default value is 0.8.<br />
<br />
At 0.8, the mouse region should cover the entire screen surface of a standard 16:9 screen,
regardless of whether the mouse region shape is rectangular or circular. For a rectangular mouse
region, it should map 1:1 with the screen's boundaries. For a circular region at this size, it will
extend the circle far enough past in both directions to contain the entire size of the screen, with
clamping applied at the edges.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="5"></a>Region Horizontal/Vertical Scale</h2>
<br />
This will scale the region on either axis. Acceptable values are between 0.0 and 1.0. Setting
horizontal and vertical scale to different values will allow you to stretch the mouse region and
achieve different rectangular and/or elliptical shapes.<br />
<br />
Choosing 0.0 for both scales will compress your mouse region into a point.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="6"></a>Click Binding</h2>
<br />
This action will be triggered when you click the pad/stick.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="7"></a>Touch Binding</h2>
(touch controls only)<br />
<br />
An action can be sent while touching the pad. This button will be released when you stop touching.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="8"></a>Horizontal/Vertical Position</h2>
<br />
These let you set the on-screen position that the mouse region is centered upon. Note that 0,0
represents the upper-left corner of the screen and 1,1 represents the lower-right.<br />
<br />
This is the center point for the mouse region, so if you put a mouse region center in one of the
four corners of the screen, effectively only 1/4 of your mouse region's area will be available --
off-screen movement will be clamped.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="9"></a>Haptics Intensity</h2>
<br />
This sets the intensity of the Haptic feedback (vibrations in the trackpad).
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="10"></a>Additional Settings</h2>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="11"></a>Snap Mouse To Region On Mode Shift</h2>
(if used with a mode shift)<br />
<br />
When enabling the mode shift, this controls whether the mouse should be snapped to the center of the
region or not.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="12"></a>Snap Mouse Back on Stop</h2>
<br />
This controls whether the mouse should be snapped back to its former position when this mouse region
stops receiving input. This happens when either the input source that controls it stops receiving
input, or the mode shift that triggered it ends.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="13"></a>Trigger Press Mouse Dampening</h2>
<br />
This setting is non-functional for mouse regions, and will be removed soon.
