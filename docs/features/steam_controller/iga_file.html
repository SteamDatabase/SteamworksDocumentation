<h1>In-Game Actions File</h1>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Overview</h2>
<br />Developers must supply an in-game actions (IGA) file that defines the actions, action sets,
and basic structure of their game's input configuration. This article describes the overall
structure of this file and provides several concrete examples from various games.

<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="3"></a>Authoring an In-Game Actions File by hand</h2>
Start by downloading the starting one of the in-game actions (IGA) files linked in the examples
above. Next, create a "controller_config" directory inside the Steam folder, usually C:/Program
Files (x86)/Steam/controller_config, and place the file in the directory. The Steam folder will
already have a very similarly named folder so make sure you've put it in the "controller_config"
folder and not the "controller_base" folder. Rename the file to the following: "game_actions_X.vdf",
where X is your game's Steam AppID. If you don't know what your game's Steam AppID is, it can be
found by logging into your Steam partner site.<br /><br />Now open up the file in your favorite text
editor. The file is in a standard Valve format called KeyValues, which is a simple &amp; easily read
format. You might also find it useful to download one of our In-Game Actions File Templates or the
Portal 2 IGA for a reference.
<h2 class="bb_subsection">
    <a name="4"></a>Generating an IGA file from an existing game that uses Steam Input API
</h2>
<br />If you save a configuration for any game on steam as a "local" configuration, you can then
find a corresponding file in:<br />
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight"
    >[SteamDirectory]\UserData\[youruserid]\241100\remote\controller_config\[appid]\[savename].vdf</code
><br /><br />Here's an example of where my local configurations for <i>Defender's Quest</i> are
stored on a typical Windows 10 machine:<br /><br /><img

    alt="whereisvgf.png"
    title="whereisvgf.png"
/><br /><br />Note that these files are not exact replicas of the master IGA file uploaded by the
developer, but you can get an idea for the original structure by looking at the "actions" and
"localization" blocks, which are drawn directly from the master file.<br /><br />Here's a download
link for the

    >#library_controllersavedefaulttitle_0.vdf</a

file shown in the above screenshot, you might find it useful to compare that to the master
<i>Defender's Quest</i> IGA.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="5"></a>IGA Format</h2>
<br />The IGA file takes the form of a VDF document, which is Valve's own data format for creating
structured object data with key/value string pairs.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="6"></a>Skeleton</h2>
<br />The basic structure of the file is a wrapper object with the name "In Game Actions", and two
sub objects, named "actions", and "localization", respectively:<br /><br />
<div class="bb_code">"In Game Actions" { "actions" { } "localization" { } }</div>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="7"></a>Action Sets</h2>
Let's zoom into the "actions" object. This object will contain your action sets. The structure of an
"actions" object looks like this:<br />
<div class="bb_code">
    "actions" { "ActionSetNameGoesHere" { "title" "#TitleGoesHere" "StickPadGyro" { }
    "AnalogTrigger" { } "Button" { } } }
</div>
<br />The strings
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">"ActionSetNameGoesHere"</code> and
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">"#TitleGoesHere"</code> are the only strings in the
above example the user should replace, the rest are reserved key words.<br /><br />The value you
replace <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">"ActionSetNameGoesHere"</code> with will be
the name of the action set that you use in the Steam Input API. And the value you replace
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">"#TitleGoesHere"</code> with will be the
localization token you use in the
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">"localization"</code> section later in the file.
Note that the # sign is required here.<br /><br />Each action set should have a unique string name,
and you add more just by creating more objects within the scope of the "actions" container object.
No commas or square brackets are necessary -- this is VDF, not JSON.<br /><br />There are three
possible sub-objects for each action set object. They are
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">"StickPadGyro"</code>,
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">"AnalogTrigger"</code>, and
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">"Button"</code>. These are the only possible
objects you can define, and they are the containers that will house your individual action
definitions. You do not have to provide all three categories, however.<br /><br />This structure is
perfectly valid, for instance:<br />
<div class="bb_code">
    "actions" { "ActionSetName1" { "title" "#Title1" "AnalogTrigger" { } "Button" { } }
    "ActionSetName2" { "title" "#Title2" "StickPadGyro" { } } "ActionSetName3" { "title" "#Title3"
    "Button" { } } }
</div>
<br /><strong>StickPadGyro</strong><br /><br />This action set block is for analog actions that will
have up to two axes of motion, the sort of thing you might want to bind to a
joy<strong>stick</strong>, a track<strong>pad</strong>, or a <strong>gyro</strong>scope. Also,
anything you might want to control with a mouse or anything else like that should go in here.<br /><br /><strong
    >AnalogTrigger</strong
><br /><br />This action set block is for analog actions that will have only one axis of motion, the
sort of thing you might want to bind to an analog trigger.<br /><br /><strong>Button</strong
><br /><br />This action set block is for purely digital actions, which only report an on/off state.
Despite the name of this block being "button," digital actions can be bound to just about any
physical inputs -- including ones originally designed to output analog data (such as joysticks,
trackpads, etc).
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="8"></a>Actions</h2>
<br />An IGA file won't actually do anything until it's got some actions defined, so let's add
some!<br /><br /><strong>StickPadGyro Actions</strong><br /><br />Let's start by adding some
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">StickPadGyro</code> (2-axis analog) actions. How
about something to move the character around -- we'll call it "Move", and something to control the
camera -- we'll call it "Camera."<br /><br />
<div class="bb_code">
    "actions" { "FPSControls" { "title" "#Set_FPSControls" "StickPadGyro" { "Move" { "title"
    "#Action_Move" "input_mode" "joystick_move" } "Camera" { "title" "#Action_Camera" "input_mode"
    "absolute_mouse" } } } }
</div>
<br />As you can see the abstract structure for a
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">StickPadGyro</code> action is:<br />
<div class="bb_code">
    "ActionNameHere" { "title" "#ActionTitleHere" "input_mode" "&lt;analog_mode&gt;" }
</div>
<br />The only user-editable values in this structure are the ones I've marked "ActionNameHere",
"#ActionTitleHere", and "&lt;analog_mode&gt;". Respectively, they correspond to the action's string
name for use in the Steam Input API, the localization key for use in this file's localization
section and the Input Source Mode that governs how the analog data is processed and interpreted.<br /><br />The
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">"input_mode"</code> property has two possible
values for <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">StickPadGyro</code> actions:<br /><br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li><code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">"joystick_move"</code><br /></li>
    <li><code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">"absolute_mouse"</code></li>
</ul>
<br />You should use <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">"joystick_move"</code> for an
action whose values are interpreted as a joystick (constant deflection from a central point), and
you should use <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">"absolute_mouse"</code> for a more
flexible general purpose analog action. When in doubt, use
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">"absolute_mouse"</code>.
<div class="bb_callout bb_red">
    <div>
        <h3><strong>"joystick_move"</strong> vs. <strong>"absolute_mouse"</strong></h3>
        We can’t stress enough that when creating a camera input for your first/third person game or
        anything cursor driven, you should always use the <strong>"absolute_mouse"</strong> type and
        react to deltas as if it’s a mouse.<br /><br />The API will automagically do the right thing
        here for stick based input, so you'll still get a tune-able stick input if your camera is
        applied to an analog stick (PS4/Xbox style) with full dead zones/response curves/etc. that
        you can specify in your default configuration. This same input will then work across
        joysticks, track pads, or motion control gyros (steam controller/ps4) as well as future
        support for mice.<br /><br />You should not use the <strong>"joystick_move"</strong> based
        input method for your camera, as mapping the opposite direction to get useful 1:1 data for
        pad/gyro/mouse/motion controls isn't possible.<br /><br />This also applies to cursor based
        input - <strong>"absolute_mouse"</strong> as a cursor will work just fine on stick based
        inputs, so you don't have to worry about creating your own stick based cursor, should you
        need one.
    </div>
</div>
<br />You can optionally send low-level mouse events along with your analog data. Your game will not
be able to distinguish these mouse events from those generated by your operating system. You do this
by adding the value <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">"os_mouse"</code> and assign it
a value of 1.<br /><br />Here's an example:<br />
<div class="bb_code">
    "StickPadGyro" { "Mouse" { "title" "#Action_Mouse" "input_mode" "absolute_mouse" "os_mouse" "1"
    } }
</div>
<br /><br /><strong>AnalogTrigger Actions</strong><br />AnalogTrigger actions are 1-D analog actions
which can be bound on triggers. If you are using a simple threshold of the trigger for something
like firing a gun or initiating "Aim Down Sights" mode you may want to use a Button Action instead
of an AnalogTrigger action so that users have more flexibility in rebinding.<br /><br />The
AnalogTrigger actions have a configurable deadzone in the rebinding UI and are rescaled from 0 -
1.0f between those values. Controllers with digital trigger buttons like the Nintendo Switch Pro
controller will send either 0 or 1.0 so you may want to check that you don't have any gameplay code
that depends on gradual trigger changes over time.<br /><br />AnalogTrigger actions have a simple
format, with the name of the action as the key and the localization token as the value. Like
this:<br />
<div class="bb_code">
    "AnalogTrigger" { "AccelerationAxis" "#Action_Accelerate" "BreakingAxis" "#Action_Brake" }
</div>
<br /><strong>Button Actions</strong><br /><br />Button actions also have a similar format, using
action name and localization token:<br />
<div class="bb_code">
    "Button" { "digital_action_1_name_here" "#DigitalAction1TitleHere" "digital_action_2_name_here"
    "#DigitalAction2TitleHere" }
</div>
<br />If necessary, you can define a native low-level input hardware event (like a native mouse
click) that fires alongside the action. This is useful in some edge cases where your game relies on
e.g. a finicky input stack seven layers deep that never <i>quite</i> treats simulated mouse events
from your application layer the same as those directly generated by the operating system.<br /><br />
<div class="bb_code">
    "Button" { "simple_click" "#simple_click" "fancy_click" "#fancy_click, mouse_button LEFT" }
</div>
<br />This causes the game to emit a true, operating-system-level left mouse button event every time
the "fancy_click" action is fired.
<div class="bb_callout bb_red">
    <div>
        <h3><strong>Warning! </strong></h3>
        You should never use this trick as a crutch for forcing specific fixed input bindings for
        your actions. That defeats the entire purpose of the "actions, not inputs" paradigm and
        giving the user full control over their configuration. If you find yourself using this
        feature for more than just fixing a few rare edge cases, you're probably overusing it.
    </div>
</div>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="9"></a>Action Set Layers</h2>
In addition to Action Sets you can also overlay incremental changes to the active Action Set with an
Action Set Layer. You can use this to handle specializations of a general mode like having a Sniper
layer on top of your OnFoot controls or to handle cases when you have in-game UI that pops up over
normal gameplay like voting screens. Layers are declared in their own section, ex: <br />
<div class="bb_code">
    "action_layers" { "IngameModalLayer" { "title" "#Layer_IngameModal" "legacy_set" "0" "set_layer"
    "1" "parent_set_name" "InGame" "AnalogTrigger" { } "Button" { "Modal_Accept"
    "#Action_Modal_Accept" "Modal_Decline" "#Action_Modal_Decline" } } }
</div>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="10"></a>Localization</h2>
<br />The master IGA file should include a localization section alongside the action set
definitions. The individual child objects of the localization object will be any one of the language
strings that Steam supports. Make sure you include at least one block that contains English action
titles.<br /><br />
<div class="bb_code">"localization" { "english" { "move" "Move" "camera" "Camera" } }</div>
<br />Note that the names of the properties should correspond to the localization keys you specified
in the earlier sections, except without the "#" character.<br /><br />To add additional languages,
simply add more language blocks with localized text for each entry:<br /><br />
<div class="bb_code">
    "localization" { "english" { "move" "Move" "camera" "Camera" } "spanish" { "move" "Mover"
    "camera" "Cámara" } "norwegian" { "move" "Bevege" "camera" "Kamera" } }
</div>

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="11"></a>How Steam uses your IGA file</h2>
<br />The master IGA file you create will only ever be during development (but it should still be
saved, maintained, and stored in your version control, etc). When you

for your game during development, the steam client uses your master IGA file to generate a starting
template.
