        <h5>In Brief</h5>
        Steam Cloud automatically stores files from your game on Steam's servers so your players can
        log into Steam and access their saved games from any computer.
        <h5>Level of integration</h5>
        Configuration of file paths required on Steamworks website. Alternatively, API calls
        required from within the game code to Steamworks for the game to enumerate, read, delete, or
        write files to Steam Cloud.

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Steam Cloud Overview</h2>
The Steam Cloud provides an easy and transparent remote file storage system for your game. Files
specified in the Auto-Cloud configuration or written to disk (created, modified, deleted, etc.)
using the Cloud API will automatically be replicated to the Steam servers after the game exits.<br />
<br />
If the user changes computers, the files are automatically downloaded to the new computer prior to
the game launching. The game can then access the files by reading them through the Cloud API or
reading them directly from disk as usual. Avoid machine-specific configurations such as video
settings.<br />
<br />
The Steam Client does the work of ensuring that the files are kept synchronized across all computers
the user may be accessing.<br />
<br />
Users can globally disable Cloud synchronization in the Steam Settings under Cloud by unchecking
"Enable Steam Cloud synchronization for applications which support it."<br />
<br />
Users can also disable the Cloud synchronization on a per-game basis in each game's properties.<br />
<br />

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="notes-and-best-practices"></a>Notes and Best Practices</h2>
<br />
It is important to remember that Steam will synchronize the user's Steam Cloud files for your game
before and after every session. Any matching files which change during the session will be uploaded
to Cloud storage immediately afterward. If your game writes very large files, or many small files,
to Steam Cloud, then this may cause a noticeable impact on the user's internet bandwidth and also
delay their ability to shut down Steam or re-launch the game.<br />
<br />
As a general rule, smaller files will work better. If the saved state for a given user can be split
up into different categories - things which may change frequently, and things which may not change
often - then we recommend using separate files for those categories. That way, the un-changed state
will not be re-uploaded after every session.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="2"></a>File Size Limits</h2>
<br />
The absolute limits on file sizes for Steam Cloud may change over time. Here are some current limits
and thresholds:<br />
<br />
<table>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <th>Size</th>
            <th>Restriction</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>100MB</td>
            <td>
                Maximum size for a call to ISteamRemoteStorage::FileWrite or
                ISteamRemoteStorage::FileWriteStreamWriteChunk
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>256MB</td>
            <td>
                May result in a non-optimal storage endpoint choice for the user's location,
                negatively impacting upload/download performance
            </td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="3"></a>Save File Paths</h2>
When deciding where to write your save files, be sure the path will be unique for the current Steam
user. If needed, you can get the user's unique Steam ID via
<a href="/doc/api/ISteamUser#GetSteamID">ISteamUser::GetSteamID</a>. From that, you can access their
accountID from GetAccountID(), allowing you to have a unique variable when constructing your save
path.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="4"></a>Cross-Platform Saves</h2>
<br />
If your game is supported on multiple platforms - or even if you plan to support this in the future
- you should consider this when setting up Steam Cloud for your game.<br />
<br />
If you plan to read/write files directly via the
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">ISteamRemoteStorage</code> interface, then you can
control platform sync via
<a href="/doc/api/ISteamRemoteStorage#SetSyncPlatforms">ISteamRemoteStorage::SetSyncPlatforms</a>.
The default for a new file is to sync to <strong>all</strong> platforms.<br />
<br />
If you plan to use <a href="#steam_auto-cloud">Steam Auto-Cloud</a>, there are some key things to
know. First, the default for new files is to sync to <strong>only</strong> the
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">OS</code> setting on the associated Auto Cloud Root
path. This means that if you set up distinct roots for each OS, all files will be partitioned by
platform, and hence there will be no cross-platform save functionality.<br />
<br />
To enable cross-platform saves, you should instead define a single Root path (likely for Windows),
and then create <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">Root Overrides</code> for the other
supported platforms. Files matching a given Root path which also has platform Root Overrides will
sync to all platforms in both the original Root and all Overrides. See the
<a href="#steam_auto-cloud">Steam Auto-Cloud</a> documentation for more details.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="initial-setup"></a>Initial Setup</h2>
To set up Steam Cloud you must set the
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">Byte quota per user</code> and
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">Number of files allowed per user</code> options on
the <a href="/apps/cloud/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Steam Cloud Settings</a> page in the
Steamworks App Admin panel.<br />
<br />
This quota is enforced on each Cloud-enabled game, on a per-user-per-game basis. It's recommended to
set the values to reasonable amounts for your game title.<br />
<br />
<strong>NOTE:</strong> Don't forget to click Save at the bottom of the page, and Publish your
updated settings. Once published the cloud icon will be visible in the Steam client for anyone that
owns your game.<br />
<br />
If your game has already been released to the public then you can check the box labeled
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">Enable cloud support for developers only</code>. If
developers-only mode is enabled then only the steam accounts which own a "Developer Comp" license
for your title will see the cloud icon and will be able to use the Steam Cloud. This is useful to
safely test Steam Cloud integration without breaking the public user experience. This has no effect
on unreleased games since no one owns the game yet, they won't be able to see or access any cloud
storage for the specific app ID.<br />
<br />
You are able to share Cloud storage space between two app IDs by filling out the
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">Shared cloud APP ID</code> field. This is most
commonly used to share saved games between a demo and a full game. A value of
<strong>0</strong> disables this feature. (Note: trying to use shared cloud data with an unreleased
target/base app will not sync those files and is not a recommended setup).
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="5"></a>Steam Cloud API and Steam Auto-Cloud</h2>
Steam provides two different methods of utilizing the Steam Cloud, read up on how the two methods
differ, and determine which would be the best for your application.<br />
<br />
First up is the Steam Cloud API.<br />
The Cloud API provides a series of functions which allows you to directly integrate the Steam Cloud
into your game. The Cloud API isolates individual Steam users files from each other and provides a
greater level of control over the Steam Cloud.<br />
<br />
The Steam Cloud API is exposed via the
<a href="/doc/api/ISteamRemoteStorage">ISteamRemoteStorage</a> API interface, and you can find
example usage in the
<a href="/doc/sdk/api/example">Steamworks API Example Application (SpaceWar)</a> project.<br />
<br />
The second is <a href="#steam_auto-cloud">Steam Auto-Cloud</a>.<br />
Steam Auto-Cloud was designed for games where you choose to not integrate the Steam Cloud API. It
provides a quick and easy way to get started but lacks the flexibility that is available with the
Steam Cloud API.<br />
<br />
If you prefer a deeper integration with Steam Cloud (for example, allowing to choose which save
files are stored in the cloud), then you should use the Cloud API. Otherwise you can use Steam
Auto-Cloud.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="steam_auto-cloud"></a>Steam Auto-Cloud</h2>
Steam Auto-Cloud is an alternative to the Steam Cloud API that allows apps to use Steam Cloud
without writing code or modifying the game in any way. It only requires that you specify the file
groups which you want persisting to the Cloud. Steam will automatically sync the groups of files
when the application launches and exits. Avoid machine-specific configurations such as video
quality.
<div class="bb_callout">
    <div>
        Note: The file steam_autocloud.vdf will be created in each location specified by your
        Steamworks cloud paths. This file is used by Steam, and can be ignored by your game.
    </div>
</div>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="setup"></a>Setup</h2>
After completing the <a href="#initial-setup">Initial Setup</a> the Steam Auto-Cloud configuration
section will unlock on the
<a href="/apps/cloud/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Steam Cloud Settings</a> page.<br />
<br />
Root Paths describe groups of files that will be persisted to the Steam Cloud. Each Root Path can be
as specific as a single file or as wide as all files under a given subfolder. Use a new path for
each group of files to sync.<br />
<br />
A Root Path is composed of 5 parts:<br />
<ol>
    <li>
        <h4>Root</h4>
        This is a pre-determined list of paths where game saves are commonly located.<br />

        <br />
        A note regarding the Windows %USERPROFILE% paths: The corresponding paths listed above are
        the default locations. It is now possible for the user to configure their Windows
        installation so that these folders are in different locations (not necessarily under
        %USERPROFILE%). Steam uses the necessary Windows APIs to find the current location of these
        folders, whether they are default or customized.<br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Subdirectory</h4>
        Subdirectory path to the clouded files relative to the Root. Use `.` if there is no
        subdirectory.<br />
        <br />
        <strong>Auto-Cloud special path values</strong><br />
        Auto-Cloud allows the use of unique Steam user identifiers in the
        <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">Subdirectory</code> path. This allows you
        to store save files for each Steam user on the computer separately. You can use
        <a href="/doc/api/ISteamUser#GetSteamID">ISteamUser::GetSteamID</a> in your game to get the
        current users SteamID or AccountID to save to and read from.<br />
        <ul>
            <li>
                <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">{64BitSteamID}</code> - Use this
                variable in the Steam path to insert the user's 64bit Steam ID. A 64 bit Steam ID
                looks like: 76561198027391269<br />
            </li>
            <li>
                <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">{Steam3AccountID}</code> - Use this
                variable in the Steam path to insert the user's Steam3 Account ID. An Account ID
                looks like: 67125541<br />
            </li>
        </ul>
        Example: <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">SavesDir/{64BitSteamID}</code
        ><br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Pattern</h4>
        File mask pattern to match. You can use
        <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">*</code> as a wildcard. If you want all
        files in the directory, just use
        <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">*</code>.<br />
        <br />
        Example: <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">*.sav</code><br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>OS</h4>
        Sets the Operating Systems that these files will be synced from/to. This is only required if
        the files are OS specific, which is hopefully not the case!<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Recursive</h4>
        Include sub-directories when searching for matching files. This is useful for
        sub-directories with non-deterministic names such as non-steam user names or IDs. If it's
        using a Steam ID, then using the special path values in the Subdirectory field is highly
        recommended.
    </li>
</ol>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="root_overrides"></a>Root Overrides</h2>
If your application is cross-platform and requires different directories for each OS, you can use
the Root Overrides functionality to specify an override for the Root Paths that you set above.<br />
<br />
The root paths specified above can be overridden to correspond to a different path on another OS. If
you use Root Overrides, you must specify [All OSes] in the Root OS drop-down above.<br />
<br />
A Root Override consists of 5 parts.<br />
<ol>
    <li>
        <h4>Original Root</h4>
        This corresponds to one of the Roots that you set above.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>OS</h4>
        The Operating System to apply the override on.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>New Root</h4>
        The new location that the Original Root maps to on the specified OS.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Add/Replace Path</h4>
        This allows you to optionally add a subdirectory path which is inserted between the new root
        and the original subdirectory.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Replace Path</h4>
        If enabled, it causes the path specified in Add/Replace Path to replace the original
        subdirectory entirely.
    </li>
</ol>
<h2 class="bb_subsection">
    <a name="example"></a>Example: Configuring Auto-Cloud for Unity Applications
</h2>
The following is an example of setting up Auto-Cloud for use with Unity and the
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">Application.persistentDataPath</code> property
where the value is different per OS. The Windows version is configured as the Root Path with the
company in Unity set to DefaultCompany and the Project called AutocloudSample. On macOS and
Linux/SteamOS, the alternate paths from
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">Application.persistentDataPath</code> are set in
the Add/Replace Path field and Replace Path is enabled.<br />
<br />
With these settings, Auto-Cloud files will be synchronized between the three folders as shown in the
Preview samples.<br />

If you are adding Steam Auto-Cloud to a game which has already been released and you have enabled
developer-only mode during the <a href="#initial-setup">Initial Setup</a> then you must complete
some additional steps to test the functionality.<br />
<ol>
    <li>Sign in to Steam with an account that owns the app that you are testing.<br /></li>
    <li>
        Open the Steam Console by navigating to
        <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">steam://open/console</code> in your
        browser.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Enter
        <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">testappcloudpaths &lt;AppId&gt;</code> into
        the console with the given App ID that you are testing. Ex:
        <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">testappcloudpaths 480</code><br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Enter <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">set_spew_level 4 4</code> into the
        console.<br />
    </li>
    <li>Launch your app from Steam.<br /></li>
    <li>
        Check the console for activity, If files already exist in the Auto-Cloud paths then you
        should see them being uploaded. Otherwise save some files from your app and then close it to
        trigger a sync.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Go to another PC and repeat the steps above to test downloading the files from Steam
        Auto-Cloud.<br />
    </li>
    <li>Be sure to test on all supported operating systems.<br /></li>
    <li>
        Set <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">testappcloudpaths 0</code> and
        <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">set_spew_level 0 0</code> to end testing.
        You can restart the Steam client to get rid of the console tab.
    </li>
</ol>
<br />
Don't forget to disable developers-only mode and publish the changes when you're done testing.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="dynamic_cloud_sync"></a>Dynamic Cloud Sync</h2>
<br />
Steam Cloud now supports dynamic sync - where changes appearing in the Cloud can be downloaded to
the local machine during an application session. The current example is a suspended game session on
the Steam Deck. For apps marked as supporting dynamic Cloud sync, Steam will synchronize files up to
the Steam Cloud at the suspend time. Then, the user may run the game on another device, which will
receive the updates from the Steam Deck session at launch. At exit, those changes will be uploaded
to the Steam Cloud. Finally, when the Steam Deck device is awakened, Steam will synchronize the
changes down to that device, and post a notification to the application that local files have
changed. The application can then iterate those changes and take appropriate action. For instance,
the game may be able to simply load the updated progress from disk and allow the user to pick up
right where they left off on the other device. <br />

Steam Cloud at the time when the user initiates a system suspend.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="dynamic_sync_testing"></a>Pre-release Testing</h2>
<br />
You can locally enable Dynamic Cloud Sync for your app to test your builds - this is recommended for
a game that has already shipped, as enabling Dynamic Cloud Sync for all users could lead to data
loss when running builds that do not handle the new API methods and callbacks.<br />
<br />
To test locally from a PC:<br />
<br />
<ol>
    <li>Sign in to Steam with an account that owns the app that you are testing.<br /></li>
    <li>
        Open the Steam Console by navigating to
        <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">steam://open/console</code> in your
        browser. (You can also run Steam with the command-line
        <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">steam -console</code> and then navigate to
        the Console section directly).<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Enter
        <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight"
            >@cloud_testdynamicsyncapp &lt;AppId&gt;</code
        >
        into the console with the given App ID that you are testing. Ex:
        <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">@cloud_testdynamicsyncapp 480</code><br />
    </li>
    <li>Launch your app from Steam.<br /></li>
    <li>Progress through the game to a desired amount<br /></li>
    <li>
        In the Steam Console, enter
        <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">prepare_for_suspend</code>. Steam will
        suspend your game process and upload any changed files to the Steam Cloud.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Optional: play the game on another device, creating further progress, and then exit and let
        that Steam client upload progress to the Steam Cloud.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Back on the original device, in the Steam Console, enter
        <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">resume_suspended_games</code>. This will
        sync down any necessary files from the Steam Cloud, post the relevant API calls to your
        game, then un-suspend your game process.
    </li>
</ol>

    <li>
        Connect your Steam Deck with a <a href="/doc/steamdeck/devkits/loadgames">Devkit</a><br />
    </li>
    <li>
        To use the CEF Console, see
        <a href="/doc/steamdeck/devkits/loadgames#client_console">here</a><br />
    </li>
    <li>
        In the JS console, enter
        <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight"
            >SteamClient.Console.ExecCommand(“@cloud_testdynamicsyncapp &lt;AppId&gt;”)</code
        >
        to enable testing. You can then enter
        <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight"
            >SteamClient.Console.ExecCommand(“@cloud_testdynamicsyncapp 0”)</code
        >
        to disable it
    </li>
</ol>
