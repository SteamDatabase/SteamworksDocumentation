        <h5>In Brief</h5>
        Steam Cloud automatically stores files from your game on Steam's servers so your players can
        log into Steam and access their saved games from any computer.
        <h5>Level of integration</h5>
        Configuration of file paths required on Steamworks website. Optionally, some API calls
        required from within game code to Steamworks for upload, download, enumerate, and delete.

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Steam Cloud Overview</h2>
The Steam Cloud provides an easy and transparent remote file storage system for your game. Files
specified in the Auto-Cloud configuration or written to disk (created, modified, deleted, etc.)
using the Cloud API will automatically be replicated to the Steam servers after the game exits.<br /><br />If
the user changes computers, the files are automatically downloaded to the new computer prior to the
game launching. The game can then access the files by reading them through the Cloud API or reading
them directly from disk as usual. Avoid machine specific configurations such as video settings.<br /><br />The
Steam Client does the work of ensuring that the files are kept synchronized across all computers the
user may be accessing.<br /><br />Users can globally disable Cloud synchronization in the Steam
Settings under Cloud by unchecking "Enable Steam Cloud synchronization for applications which
support it."<br /><br />Users can also disable the Cloud synchronization on a per game basis in each
games properties.<br /><br /><img

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="initial-setup"></a>Notes and Best Practices</h2>
<br />It is important to remember that Steam will synchronize the user's Steam Cloud files for your
game before and after every session. Any matching files which change during the session will be
uploaded to Cloud storage immediately afterward. If your game writes very large files, or many small
files, to Steam Cloud, then this may cause a noticeable impact on the user's internet bandwidth and
also delay their ability to shut down Steam or re-launch the game.<br /><br />As a general rule,
smaller files will work better. If the saved state for a given user can be split up into different
categories - things which may change frequently, and things which may not change often - then we
recommend using separate files for those categories. That way, the un-changed state will not be
re-uploaded after every session.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="2"></a>File Size Limits</h2>
<br />The absolute limits on file sizes for Steam Cloud may change over time. Here are some current
limits and thresholds:<br /><br />
<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Size</th>
        <th>Restriction</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>100MB</td>
        <td>
            Maximum size for a call to ISteamRemoteStorage::FileWrite or
            ISteamRemoteStorage::FileWriteStreamWriteChunk
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>256MB</td>
        <td>
            May result in a non-optimal storage endpoint choice for the user's location, negatively
            impacting upload/download performance
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="initial-setup"></a>Initial Setup</h2>
To set up Steam Cloud you must set the
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">Byte quota per user</code> and
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">Number of files allowed per user</code> options on
the
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/apps/cloud/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
    >Steam Cloud Settings</a
>
page in the Steamworks App Admin panel.<br /><br />This quota is enforced on each Cloud-enabled
game, on a per-user-per-game basis. It's recommended to set the values to reasonable amounts for
your game title.<br /><br /><strong>NOTE:</strong> Don't forget to click Save at the bottom of the
page, and Publish your updated settings. Once published the cloud icon will be visible in the Steam
client for anyone that owns your game.<br /><br />If your game has already been released to the
public then you can check the box labeled
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">Enable cloud support for developers only</code>. If
developers-only mode is enabled then only the steam accounts which own a "Developer Comp" license
for your title will see the cloud icon and will be able to use the Steam Cloud. This is useful to
safely test Steam Cloud integration without breaking the public user experience. This has no effect
on unreleased games since no one owns the game yet, they won't be able to see or access any cloud
storage for the specific app ID.<br /><br />You are able to share Cloud storage space between two
app IDs by filling out the
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">Shared cloud APP ID</code> field. This is most
commonly used to share saved games between a demo and a full game. A value of
<strong>0</strong> disables this feature.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="3"></a>Steam Cloud API and Steam Auto-Cloud</h2>
Steam provides two different methods of utilizing the Steam Cloud, read up on how the two methods
differ, and determine which would be the best for your application.<br /><br />First up is the Steam
Cloud API.<br />The Cloud API provides a series of functions which allows you to directly integrate
the Steam Cloud into your game. The Cloud API isolates individual Steam users files from each other
and provides a greater level of control over the Steam Cloud.<br /><br />The Steam Cloud API is
exposed via the
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamRemoteStorage" class="bb_apilink"
    >ISteamRemoteStorage</a
>
API interface, and you can find example usage in the
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/sdk/api/example" class="bb_doclink"
    >Steamworks API Example Application (SpaceWar)</a
>
project.<br /><br />The second is
<a href="#steam_auto-cloud" class="bb_doclink">Steam Auto-Cloud</a>.<br />Steam Auto-Cloud was
designed for games where you choose to not integrate the Steam Cloud API. It provides a quick and
easy way to get started but lacks the flexibility that is available with the Steam Cloud API.<br /><br />If
you prefer a deeper integration with Steam Cloud (for example, allowing to choose which save files
are stored in the cloud), then you should use the Cloud API. Otherwise you can use Steam Auto-Cloud.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="steam_auto-cloud"></a>Steam Auto-Cloud</h2>
Steam Auto-Cloud is an alternative to the Steam Cloud API that allows apps to use Steam Cloud
without writing code or modifying the game in any way. It only requires that you specify the file
groups which you want persisted to the Cloud. Steam will automatically sync the groups of files when
the application launches and exits. Avoid machine specific configurations such as video quality.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="setup"></a>Setup</h2>
After completing the <a href="#initial-setup" class="bb_doclink">Initial Setup</a> the Steam
Auto-Cloud configuration section will unlock on the
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/apps/cloud/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
    >Steam Cloud Settings</a
>
page.<br /><br />Root Paths describe groups of files which will be persisted to the Steam Cloud.
Each Root Path can be as specific as a single file or as wide as all files under a given subfolder.
Use a new path for each group of files to sync.<br /><br />A Root Path is composed of 5 parts:<br />
<ol class="bb_ol ">

        <h4>Subdirectory</h4>
        Subdirectory path to the clouded files relative to the Root. Use `.` if there is no
        subdirectory.<br /><br />
        <strong>Auto-Cloud special path values</strong><br />
        Auto-Cloud allows the use of unique Steam user identifiers in the
        <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">Subdirectory</code> path. This allows you
        to store save files for each Steam user on the computer separately. You can use
        <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamUser#GetSteamID" class="bb_apilink"
            >ISteamUser::GetSteamID</a
        >
        in your game to get the current users SteamID or AccountID to save to and read from.<br />
        <ul class="bb_ul ">
            <li>
                <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">{64BitSteamID}</code> - Use this
                variable in the steam path to insert the users 64bit Steam ID. A 64 bit Steam ID
                looks like: 76561198027391269<br />
            </li>
            <li>
                <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">{Steam3AccountID}</code> - Use this
                variable in the steam path to insert the users Steam 3 Account ID. An Account ID
                looks like: 67125541<br />
            </li>

    <li>
        <h4>Pattern</h4>
        File mask pattern to match. You can use
        <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">*</code> as a wildcard. If you want all
        files in the directory, just use
        <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">*</code>.<br /><br />
        Example: <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">*.sav</code><br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>OS</h4>
        Sets the Operating Systems that these files will be synced from/to. This is only required if
        the files are OS specific, which is hopefully not the case!<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Recursive</h4>
        Include sub-directories when searching for matching files. This is useful for
        sub-directories with non-deterministic names such as non-steam user names or IDs. If it's
        using a Steam ID, then using the special path values in the Subdirectory field is highly
        recommended.
    </li>
</ol>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="root_overrides"></a>Root Overrides</h2>
If your application is cross-platform and requires different directories for each OS. You can use
the Root Overrides functionality to specify an override the Root Paths that you set above.<br /><br />The
root paths specified above can be overridden to correspond to a different path on another OS. If you
use Root Overrides, you must specify [All OSes] in the Root OS drop down above.<br /><br />A Root
Override consists of 5 parts.<br />
<ol class="bb_ol ">
    <li>
        <h4>Original Root</h4>
        This corresponds to one of the Roots that you set above.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>OS</h4>
        The Operating System to apply the override on.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>New Root</h4>
        The new location that the Original Root maps to on the specified OS.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Add/Replace Path</h4>
        This allows you to optionally add a subdirectory path which is inserted between the new root
        and the original subdirectory.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Replace Path</h4>
        If enabled, it causes the path specified in Add/Replace Path to replace the original
        subdirectory entirely.
    </li>
</ol>
<h2 class="bb_subsection">
    <a name="example"></a>Example: Configuring Auto-Cloud for Unity Applications
</h2>
The following is an example of setting up Auto-Cloud for use with Unity and the
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">Application.persistentDataPath</code> property
where the value is different per OS. The Windows version is configured as the Root Path with the
company in Unity set to DefaultCompany and the Project called AutocloudSample. On macOS and
Linux/SteamOS, the alternate paths from
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">Application.persistentDataPath</code> are set in

If you are adding Steam Auto-Cloud to a game which is already released and you have enabled
developer-only mode during the
<a href="#initial-setup" class="bb_doclink">Initial Setup</a> then you must complete some additional
steps to test the functionality.<br />
<ol class="bb_ol ">
    <li>
        Sign in to Steam with an account that owns a Developer Comp license for the app that you are
        testing.<br />

    <li>Launch your app from Steam.<br /></li>
    <li>
        Check the console for activity, If files already exist in the Auto-Cloud paths then you
        should see them being uploaded. Otherwise save some files from your app and then close it to
        trigger a sync.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Go to another PC and repeat the steps above to test downloading the files from Steam
        Auto-Cloud.<br />
    </li>
    <li>Be sure to test on all supported operating systems.<br /></li>
    <li>
        Set <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">testcloudapppaths 0</code> and
        <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">set_spew_level 0 0</code> to end testing.
        You can restart the Steam client to get rid of the console tab.
    </li>
</ol>
<br />Don't forget to disable developers-only mode and publish the changes when you're done testing.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="debugging"></a>Debugging</h2>
First, always ensure that you have published your changes on the Steam partner website and have
waited up to 10 minutes or restarted your Steam client to receive the published changes.<br /><br />If
you run into issues with Steam Cloud you should check the log file located at
