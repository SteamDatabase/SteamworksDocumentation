To create a recurring subscription for a Steam user, you first need to establish a billing agreement
with the user, which describes the payment terms. These terms include the recurring price, and at
what frequency that price is billed to the user. The user must agree to these terms before the
recurring subscription can begin. Payment process is then handled by Steam, which can send results
back to the game's own server.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="2"></a>Establishing a Billing Agreement</h2>
Similar to selling a microtransaction item, to create a billing agreement, your backend server will
need to call the WebAPI <a href="/doc/webapi/ISteamMicroTxn#InitTxn">ISteamMicroTxn/InitTxn</a>. The
call to InitTxn will then require some additional parameters to fully define it. If the transaction
is accepted by Steam, the user will be notified to authorize the agreement and the API will return a
unique 64-bit billing agreementID in the response. If an error is returned then the problem will
need to be corrected and a new request submitted. Once approved, you should use the
<a href="/doc/webapi/ISteamMicroTxn#FinalizeTxn">ISteamMicroTxn/FinalizeTxn</a> WebAPI to complete
the agreement.<br />
<br />
The additional parameters needed for InitTxn are:<br />
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>billingtype[0]</strong> - Valid options are: "Steam" or "Game". Using "Steam" is the
        preferred method<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>period[0]</strong> - Period for recurring billing. Valid options are: "Day", "Week",
        "Month", "Year"<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>frequency[0]</strong> - Frequency (in number of days) for recurring billing.
        Supported values: 1 - 255<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>recurringamt[0]</strong> - Optional amount to be billed for future recurring billing
        transactions. Note that this parameter is only needed if you want your initial price to be
        different than the recurring price. recurringamt can be omitted if the initial price is the
        same as your recurring price
    </li>
</ul>
<br />
A user may only have one active billing agreement per game. You may create a new billing agreement
for a user at any time, but all previous billing agreements will be disabled upon completing a
<a href="/doc/webapi/ISteamMicroTxn#FinalizeTxn">ISteamMicroTxn/FinalizeTxn</a> call. Each billing
agreement will be given a unique 64-bit ID that you can use to reference it, but only the most
recent agreement will be allowed to process payment.<br />
<br />
Users can elect to cancel an agreement at any time from within their Steam account settings.
Notification of cancellations will be done through the
<a href="/doc/webapi/ISteamMicroTxn#GetReport">ISteamMicroTxn/GetReport</a> Web API.<br />
<br />
If your billing agreement is set to the "Game" type, then your backend server will need to the
WebAPI <a href="/doc/webapi/ISteamMicroTxn#ProcessAgreement">ISteamMicroTxn/ProcessAgreement</a> to
charge the user on each recurring event. This is only useful if you have a system where the user may
be charged less than the initial or recurring amount, as the call to ProcessAgreement will take an
amount value to charge the user.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="3"></a>Receiving Status</h2>
<br />
To receive payment status for a billing agreement, your game server should call the WebAPI
<a href="/doc/webapi/ISteamMicroTxn#GetReport">ISteamMicroTxn/GetReport</a>. GetReport will show all
transactions associated with your game (appID), including those produced by a billing agreement.
Additionally, since users can cancel and renew subscriptions from within their Steam account, the
game can receive notification of those actions through this API. Your game server should call
GetReport frequently, at least every couple of seconds, so that it can always be up-to-date.<br />
<br />
Additional Web APIs for recurring payments are:<br />
<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="/doc/webapi/ISteamMicroTxn#CancelAgreement">ISteamMicroTxn/CancelAgreement</a> -
        Cancels a recurring billing agreement.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="/doc/webapi/ISteamMicroTxn#GetUserAgreementInfo"
            >ISteamMicroTxn/GetUserAgreementInfo</a
        >
        - Get detailed information of the recurring billing agreement for a user.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="/doc/webapi/ISteamMicroTxn#AdjustAgreement">ISteamMicroTxn/AdjustAgreement</a> -
        Add time to the payment schedule of an agreement
    </li>
</ul>
