<h1>Microtransactions Implementation Guide</h1>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Overview</h2>
The goal of the Steam in-game payment system is to provide an easy way for developers to sell
arbitrary goods to users such that the user never has to leave the game experience. It's completely
up to the merchant what they want to sell. It can be in-game items like weapons or ammunition, game
currency like coins or gold, or even attire for your player character. You can have as many or as
few items as you like in your game and you can sell them one at a time or as bundled groups. Steam
places no restrictions on what you sell or how you sell it nor does it preclude the use of whatever
other mechanisms your game has for selling items. Its purpose is to bring a common payment
experience that user's are familiar with from the Steam platform into your game and allow them to
easily spend their Steam wallet value on your products. Using this type of integration, your game
will have immediate access to new Steam users and payment methods as soon as they become
available.<br /><br />With this system, the purchase is completely under your control. A successful
response to a purchase request will result in the user reliably getting charged and you getting
positive and immediate notification of the event. Once a purchase is approved, it's up to you to
grant and manage the items. If an item is time based for example, your system dictates how long that
item is good for.<br /><br />In addition to in-game purchasing, the system will provide additional
functionality that your accounting and support systems can use:<br />
<ol class="bb_ol">
    <li>You can receive notification if customers fail to pay.<br /></li>
    <li>You can issue refunds and query transaction status through the web service.<br /></li>
    <li>
        You will have access to detailed reports on our steamstats partner site showing live sales
        of items and games.
    </li>
</ol>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="2"></a>Best Practices for In-Game Purchases</h2>
If you are working to bring your title with in-game purchases to Steam, we've got a few suggestions,
best practices, and resources to help you get started. Whether you have a Free to Play game, or a
game that is purchased upfront, there are common elements with any game that has in-game purchases
that are useful to consider when working toward your launch on Steam.<br /><br />Please see the
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/features/microtransactions" class="bb_doclink"
    >Microtransactions (In-Game Purchases)</a
>
documentation for suggestions for in-game economies and best practices.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="3"></a>How the Payment System Works</h2>
The payment system is a combination of whatever purchase process you have in-game, the Steam billing
web service, and a customer approval process.<br /><br />The purchase process occurs in the
following sequence. Your user always starts and completes their order in your game.<br />
<ol class="bb_ol">
    <li>
        When a user wishes to buy something in-game, your game sends a purchase request to your
        purchasing server. The purchasing server can be any service entity that your game system has
        for handling purchase requests. It could be a web server or your authentication system. The
        server will need to communicate with the Steam billing servers over HTTP. Your purchasing
        server can also request the user's country, language, and currency from the Steam billing
        servers. You can use this data to adjust your pricing as needed.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Your purchasing server then initiates a payment transaction on behalf of the client to the
        Steam web service. The request is a secure HTTP POST. The contents of this request include
        the user's metadata and a description and cost of each item that the user wishes to
        purchase.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Upon receiving this request, Steam will automatically activate the Steam overlay and present
        a dialog to the user listing all of the items, their cost and a button to confirm or
        authorize the transaction. If the user does not have enough funds in their Steam account,
        the overlay will guide the user through a funding process. The Steam overlay handles
        collecting all of the user's billing information. Upon completion, the user will receive a
        notification that the purchase was either authorized or denied. Your game should register to
        receive a callback for this notification and forward the result to your purchasing
        server.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Your purchasing server receives the notification and posts a FinalizeTransaction call to
        Steam to complete the operation. A successful response will result in the user being charged
        and you can then grant the item to the user.
    </li>
</ol>
<br />Alternatively, for games whose purchasing options are typically serviced through a web page or
if you wish to offer Steam as a payment method directly on your web site, you can optionally do a
browser-based integration. For this solution the purchase process occurs in the following
sequence:<br />
<ol class="bb_ol">
    <li>
        User wishes to buy something in-game or on your web site. If in-game, you would launch a
        browser to your web page.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Your purchasing server initiates a web transaction on behalf of the user in the form of a
        secure HTTP POST. If successful, it will return a unique Steam URL that you can then
        redirect the user's browser session to and they can authorize the transaction. When you
        redirect, you will also specify a return URL where the user will be sent back to after they
        complete authorization.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        When the user is directed back to your site, your purchasing server requests status about
        the transaction and if it's been successfully authorized, you can capture funds with a
        FinalizeTransaction call to Steam.
    </li>
</ol>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="4"></a>Setting up a connection</h2>
<h4>Pre-Conditions</h4>
First create a WebAPI publisher key. Instructions can be found on the
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/webapi_overview/auth" class="bb_doclink"
    >Authentication using Web API Keys</a
>
documentation page. This key is passed with all web server requests and is used to authenticate
server requests. This should be sent as a
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">key=&lt;your key here&gt;</code> parameter with the
requests.
<h4>Store the order</h4>
Store each order for later reference in your system. Use a unique 64-bit Order ID to reference the
transactions within Steam.
<h4>Submitting requests</h4>
All requests should be sent using HTTP 1.1 GET or POST using an SSL v3, 128 bit encryption. The
Content-Type should be "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" and the POST parameters should be in the
body of the request in standard form urlencoding format. Text should be transmitted as UTF-8.<br /><br />Requests
will go through the base URI:<br /><code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight"
    >https://partner.steam-api.com/ISteamMicroTxn/*</code
><br /><br />Some commands return a pass or fail result. For cases where a fail result is returned,
an additional error code and description will be appended. These keys will not be present for a pass
response.<br /><br />Responses will be returned in JSON format by default. You may optionally
specify XML format by adding the "format=xml" parameter to the request.<br />
Note: You must implement a flexible JSON or XML solution that allows parameter keys to be posted and
returned in arbitrary order.
<h4>Testing</h4>
Steam offers a developer sandbox to test your integration. The sandbox supports all requests
available through the regular API but no actual funds will be withdrawn from the tester's Steam
wallet.<br /><br />The sandbox is accessed through a different base URI:<br /><code
    class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight"
    >https://partner.steam-api.com/ISteamMicroTxnSandbox/*</code
>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="5"></a>Integration Steps</h2>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="6"></a>In-Game Purchasing</h2>
<br />This is for games that have an integrated store and the user experience will stay in-game.<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        <strong>Step 1</strong><br />
        Your game needs to ship with the Steamworks API. This means including a header file, linking
        in a lib file, and shipping a DLL with your product. Refer to
        <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/sdk/api" class="bb_doclink"
            >Steamworks API Overview</a
        >
        for more details. The Steamworks API must be successfully initialized before continuing!<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Step 2</strong><br />
        The user elects to purchase one or more items within your game. Once an item (or items) has
        been identified, your game needs to collect some metadata about the user:<br />
        <ul class="bb_ul">
            <li>
                Steam ID - This 64-bit number uniquely identifies the user within the Steam
                system.<br />
            </li>
            <li>
                Country code - The ISO 3166 country code of the user indicates where the user is
                purchasing from. Use this to determine what price to apply for the purchase.<br />
            </li>
            <li>
                Currency code - The ISO 4217 currency code that the user will be charged in.<br />
            </li>
            <li>
                Client game language code - The ISO 639-1 language code that the Steam client game
                is currently running.<br />
            </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        The Steam ID and language can be obtained from the Steamworks API calls:<br />
        <ul class="bb_ul">
            <li>
                <a
                    href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamUser#GetSteamID"
                    class="bb_apilink"
                    >ISteamUser::GetSteamID</a
                ><br />
            </li>
            <li>
                <a
                    href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamApps#GetCurrentGameLanguage"
                    class="bb_apilink"
                    >ISteamApps::GetCurrentGameLanguage</a
                ><br />
            </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        To get the country and currency type for the user, use the
        <a
            href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/webapi/ISteamMicroTxn#GetUserInfo"
            class="bb_apilink"
            >ISteamMicroTxn/GetUserInfo</a
        >
        web API request passing it the user's Steam ID.<br /><br />
        This user metadata should be bundled and sent with your regular purchasing data to your
        purchasing server.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Step 3</strong><br />
        Your purchasing server initiates a purchase request through the Steam web service on behalf
        of the Steam client. Use the
        <a
            href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/webapi/ISteamMicroTxn#InitTxn"
            class="bb_apilink"
            >ISteamMicroTxn/InitTxn</a
        >
        described later in this document. You will need to send the following data with the
        request:<br />
        <ul class="bb_ul">
            <li>
                Order ID - A unique 64-bit number that you assign for this purchase. This number is
                your key to the transaction. It is used to reference the transaction within the
                Steam system.<br />
            </li>
            <li>Steam ID - The user ID received from the Steam client in step 3.<br /></li>
            <li>App ID - The unique identifier of your Steam game.<br /></li>
            <li>Language - The ISO 639-1 language code that your item(s) are listed in.<br /></li>
            <li>
                Currency - The ISO 4217 currency code that your price(s) are listed in. If this does
                not match the users's currency code provided in step 2 then an automatic currency
                conversion will be applied at the current market rate. Steam will present the
                converted price to the user, in their local currency for approval. For the best
                customer experience it is recommended that you provide specific pricing in each
                currency you expect your customers to use.<br />
            </li>
            <li>
                A list of one or more items that the user wishes to purchase. With each item you
                specify the following data:<br />
                <ul class="bb_ul">
                    <li>Item ID - Your own 32-bit identifier for the item.<br /></li>
                    <li>Quantity - Number of items of this type in the transaction.<br /></li>
                    <li>
                        Amount - The amount (in hundredths) that you wish to charge the user for
                        this item. Some currencies must be priced in full values, see
                        <a
                            href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/pricing/currencies"
                            class="bb_doclink"
                            >Supported Currencies</a
                        >
                        for more information. If the Quantity value for this item is greater than
                        one, this value is the total that will get charged (Amount = Quantity x
                        item_cost).<br />
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Item Description - A text description for the item. This will be displayed
                        to the user when they are prompted to authorize the transaction. You can
                        choose to localize this description based upon the Steam client's indicated
                        language code.<br />
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Item Category - An optional text description of a category that this item
                        should be grouped with. This value is used for grouping sales data in
                        backend Steam reporting and is never displayed to the user.<br />
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        If the transaction is accepted by Steam, the Steam client will automatically be notified to
        authorize the purchase. If an error is returned then the problem will need to be corrected
        and a new purchase transaction submitted.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Step 4</strong><br />
        A successful
        <a
            href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/webapi/ISteamMicroTxn#InitTxn"
            class="bb_apilink"
            >ISteamMicroTxn/InitTxn</a
        >
        attempt will result in the user receiving a notification via the Steam in-game overlay that
        the transaction needs to be authorized. Details of the transaction are displayed using the
        item descriptions supplied by your purchase request. The user can then authorize the
        transaction. If the user does not have sufficient funds in their account, Steam will
        automatically guide them through a funding process. At the end, your game will receive
        notification that the transaction has either been authorized or denied.<br /><br />
        Your game will need to register a
        <a
            href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamUser#MicroTxnAuthorizationResponse_t"
            class="bb_apilink"
            >ISteamUser::MicroTxnAuthorizationResponse_t</a
        >
        callback handler to receive notification of the approval (or denial) event. This callback
        result contains the AppID, OrderID, and authorization state of the transaction. Your game
        can send this result to your purchasing server so it can know to finalize the transaction.
        Refer to the
        <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/sdk/api#callbacks" class="bb_doclink"
            >Callbacks</a
        >
        documentation for more details.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Step 5</strong><br />
        Your purchasing server uses the
        <a
            href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/webapi/ISteamMicroTxn#FinalizeTxn"
            class="bb_apilink"
            >ISteamMicroTxn/FinalizeTxn</a
        >
        API command to complete the transaction with the following parameters:<br />
        <ul class="bb_ul">
            <li>Order ID - The order ID you created to initiate the transaction.<br /></li>
            <li>App ID - The unique identifier of your Steam game.<br /></li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        A successful response means that the purchase has been accepted and the items should be
        granted. An error response indicates that the purchase did not complete properly and an
        appropriate error message is given.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="7"></a>Web-based Purchasing</h2>
If your game store is a web page or you just want to add Steam as a payment method to your existing
store checkout, you can use the following steps for integration:<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        <strong>Step 1</strong><br />
        Get the user's Steam ID. <br />
        <ul class="bb_ul">
            <li>
                If the user is currently in-game, use the Steamworks API to return the Steam ID:
                <a
                    href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamUser#GetSteamID"
                    class="bb_apilink"
                    >ISteamUser::GetSteamID</a
                >.<br />
            </li>
            <li>
                If the user is at your website you can use the Steamworks OpenID API to securely
                retrieve the user's Steam ID. Details for OpenID can be found on the Steamworks
                <a
                    href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/features/auth#website"
                    class="bb_doclink"
                    >Web Browser based authentication with OpenID</a
                >
                documentation page.<br />
            </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <strong>Note:</strong> We recommend that you link the user's game account with their Steam
        ID so that the user only has to do this secondary login one time.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Step 2</strong><br />
        Get the country and currency type for the user by calling the
        <a
            href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/webapi/ISteamMicroTxn#GetUserInfo"
            class="bb_apilink"
            >ISteamMicroTxn/GetUserInfo</a
        >
        web API request passing it the user's Steam ID. This data can be used to display your store
        with appropriate pricing and currency values for the user.<br /><br />
        <strong>Note:</strong>
        <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">GetUserInfo</code> has an optional IP
        address parameter that you can use to hint to Steam where the user is originating from. Send
        the public IP address of the user for all web-based purchases or any time the user is not
        actively logged in through the Steam client and playing your game.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Step 3</strong><br />
        Your purchasing server initiates a purchase request through the Steam web service using the
        <a
            href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/webapi/ISteamMicroTxn#InitTxn"
            class="bb_apilink"
            >ISteamMicroTxn/InitTxn</a
        >. Two additional pieces of data will need to be supplied beyond what is needed for regular
        in-game purchasing:<br />
        <ul class="bb_ul">
            <li>
                usersession - This should be set to "web" indicating the user will be authenticating
                the transaction through a browser.<br />
            </li>
            <li>ipaddress - The public IP address of the user.<br /></li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        When usersession is set to WEB, the InitTxn request will return an additional steamurl
        parameter. This is a unique URL that you can redirect the user's web session to and
        identifies the transaction created by this API call.<br /><br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Step 4</strong><br />
        Your purchasing server redirects the user's web session to the Steam URL returned in the
        InitTxn API call. Along with the redirect, append your own URL which will be where the user
        is returned to after the transaction is authorized (or declined). Use a fully specified URL
        (e.g.
        <a href="http://www.steamgames.com)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
            >http://www.steamgames.com)</a
        >
        in the form of<br />
        <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">returnurl=:your_URL_here</code><br />
        When a user is redirected to the Steam URL, they will need to log into Steam before
        authenticating. If the user is selecting Steam as a payment method on your web site this
        would be expected behavior from the user's point of view. If however, the user was already
        logged into Steam and playing your game, it would be desirable to skip this second login
        requirement. This can be accomplished by using the built-in web browser capability of the
        game overlay. When the game overlay browser is used for authorization, the user will be
        logged in automatically. To launch the browser use the Steamworks API call<br />

        <strong>Step 5</strong><br />
        When the user returns to your site, issue an
        <a
            href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/webapi/ISteamMicroTxn#QueryTxn"
            class="bb_apilink"
            >ISteamMicroTxn/QueryTxn</a
        >
        API call to get the results. If the order status is "Approved" then capture funds with the
        <a
            href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/webapi/ISteamMicroTxn#FinalizeTxn"
            class="bb_apilink"
            >ISteamMicroTxn/FinalizeTxn</a
        >
        API call. Abandon the transaction if any other status returns.<br /><br />
        <strong>Note:</strong> If the user closes their browser or something happens that otherwise
        prevents their return to your site, abandon the transaction and do not issue a FinalizeTxn
        call. Even if the user approved the transaction and somehow did not get redirected back,
        abandon it and start again.

allows users to obtain a refund for in-game purchases within 48 hours of purchase as long as none of
the items purchased have been consumed, modified, or transferred. If you wish to participate in this
policy, you will need to implement the following APIs and provide us with the endpoint URL.<br />
