<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="1"></a>Introduction:</h2>
<br />Steam Cloud Play is currently in Beta and features are being added over time. We are now
accepting a limited amount of games into the service as we continue to build features and server
capacity for players. The first service we are connecting to Steam to allow users to play games from
their Steam Library from the Cloud is
<a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
    >NVIDIA GeForce NOW</a
>. There are more details below about how to opt your game(s) into the service as well as answers to
a few common questions below. <br /><br />Currently NVIDIA GeForce NOW is available in North
America, Western Europe and Asia Pacific. Currently, Steam users will need to download the GeForce
Now client and connect their Steam account to the GFN service to play their Steam Library. The user
may pay a subscription cost to use the GFN service. Customers will continue to acquire games on
Steam the same way they do today, and partner payouts will remain the same.<br /><br />These cloud
services enable Steam users to play their Steam library in the cloud, one game at a time, like they
can on their local PC. Developers must manually opt-in the games they wish to make available on
GeForce NOW. <br /><br />Below are instructions that show you how to sign up your game in
Steamworks. We are using a whitelist of games that have signed up in Steamworks. Please make sure to
take the steps below to ensure your Steam game is approved for GeForce NOW in Steamworks and will be
available on the GFN service after it has been checked by NVIDIA.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="2"></a>Cloud Saves:</h2>
<br /><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Each time a user plays a game via Cloud Play they may be playing
from a new virtual PC. For this reason it is very important that your game has
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/features/cloud" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
    >Steam Cloud</a
>
enabled or has a separate online save system of its own. If your game does not have either online
save system, players of your game may lose their progress and saves when playing a game through a
Steam Cloud Play service.

<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="4"></a>FAQ</h2>
<br /><strong
    >Will I be paid differently for sales of my game on Steam if it is opted into Steam Cloud
    Play?</strong
><br /><br />No. You will still be paid the same way you are paid now for your application sales
(both package and in game sales). Steam Cloud Play is simply giving Steam users more options on
where and how to play their PC games. It is similar to customers playing games from their Steam
Library through
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/features/remoteplay" class="bb_doclink"
    >Steam Remote Play</a
>
on another computer. <br /><br /><strong
    >Do I need to do anything special to my game to make it compatible with Steam Cloud Play
    services?</strong
><br /><br />Fortunately there is very little work to get your game working on a Steam Cloud Play
Service. You need to sign the addendum, opt each game into the program and ensure your game has
either Steam Cloud enabled or its own online save system. Most of the time these are the only
requirements. When testing your game, if another issue comes up we will reach out to you to help fix
any specific issues. <br /><br /><strong>What is GeForce NOW?</strong><br /><br />GeForce NOW is
