<h1>Steam Audio</h1>
Steam Audio is an open-source, cross-platform software toolkit for spatial audio. You can use it to
add rich, immersive positional and environmental audio effects to games and VR/AR apps. Steam Audio
offers a wide variety of features, including:
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="1"></a>Overview</h2>
<br />
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Render 3D positional audio.</strong> Steam Audio binaurally renders direct sound
        using HRTFs to accurately model the direction of a sound source relative to the listener.
        Users can get an impression of the height of the source, as well as whether the source is in
        front of or behind them.<br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Render 3D audio for Ambisonic content.</strong> Steam Audio can also spatialize
        Ambisonics audio clips, rotating them based on the listener’s orientation in the virtual
        world. This is useful for creating spatialized ambiences that are fixed in place relative to
        the virtual world.<br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Use custom HRTFs using SOFA files.</strong> In addition to its built-in HRTF, Steam
        Audio can spatialize point sources and Ambisonics sources using any HRTF specified by the
        user. These files should be in the AES standard
        <a href="https://www.sofaconventions.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">SOFA format</a
        >.<br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Model occlusion of sound sources.</strong> Steam Audio can quickly model raycast
        occlusion of direct sound by solid objects. Steam Audio also models partial occlusion for
        non-point sources, and transmission of occluded sound through the occluding geometry.<br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Model reflections and related environmental audio effects.</strong> Steam Audio can
        model how sound is reflected by solid objects. This can be used to model many kinds of
        environmental audio effects, including slap echoes, flutter echoes, occlusion of sound by
        buildings, and more.<br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Model propagation of sound along multiple paths.</strong> Steam Audio can model how
        sound propagates from the source to the listener, along multiple paths. This can be used to
        correctly spatialize sound that reaches the listener after traveling along hallways, around
        corners, through doors and windows, and more.<br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Create environmental audio effects tailored to your scene.</strong> Steam Audio
        analyzes the size, shape, layout, and material properties of rooms and objects in your
        scene. It uses this information to automatically calculate occlusion, reflections, and other
        environmental effects by simulating the physics of sound.<br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong
            >Automate the process of authoring reverbs and other environmental audio
            effects.</strong
        >
        With Steam Audio, you don’t have to manually place effect filters throughout your scene, and
        you don’t have to manually tweak the filters everywhere. Steam Audio uses an automated
        real-time or pre-computation based process where environmental audio properties are
        calculated (using physics principles) throughout your scene.<br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Change acoustics in real-time in response to moving geometry.</strong> Steam Audio
        can model how moving geometry impacts occlusion, reflections, and other environmental
        effects. For example, opening doors can result in an occluded sound becoming unoccluded;
        making a room larger during gameplay can increase the amount of reverb in it.<br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Render high-quality convolution reverbs.</strong> Steam Audio can calculate
        convolution reverb, which results in compelling environments that sound more realistic than
        with parametric reverb. This is particularly true for outdoor spaces, where parametric
        reverbs have several limitations.<br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Use multi-core CPU and GPU acceleration.</strong> Steam Audio can use multi-core
        CPUs to accelerate simulation of environmental effects. Steam Audio can also use supported
        GPUs for accelerating simulation and rendering of environmental effects, while ensuring that
        its audio workloads do not adversely impact other GPU workloads or frame rate stability.<br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Balance physical realism and artistic intent.</strong> Steam Audio lets designers
        modify the results of physics-based simulation before they are used for rendering audio
        effects. This lets designers treat the simulation results as a high-quality starting point,
        while providing many ways to tweak the results to achieve their artistic goals. For example,
        designers can adjust the material-dependent EQ filters used to model transmission of sound
        through geometry, or make a reverb tail longer or shorter while retaining the
        characteristics of the early reflections.
