<h1>VAC Integration</h1>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Goals and methodology</h2>
The goal of VAC is to strongly discourage users from using cheat software by both having strong
penalties if a user is caught cheating, and by making it hard for the cheating community to know if
a cheat is actively being detected. VAC is a component of Steamworks and the Steam client, and works
by scanning the users system for cheats while your game is running. It works a lot like a virus
scanner, and has a database of known cheats to detect. Once a cheat has been detected, the user's
account is marked for a delayed ban. A ban doesn't take effect immediately and instead is enforced a
few days after the cheats are detected. Once a user ban is in effect, the user will no longer be
able to connect to multi-player game servers that are marked as secure. Bans are tied to a user's
account, so the only way for the user get un-banned is by creating a new Steam account, and buying
another copy of the game.<br />
<br />
When a user is VAC Banned, the following happens:<br />
<ul>
    <li>The account cannot join secure servers for the AppIDs they are banned<br /></li>
    <li>The ban is publicly displayed on their Steam Community profile<br /></li>
    <li>The account can no longer share VAC enabled games<br /></li>
    <li>
        If the user is accessing the game via
        <a

            rel="noreferrer"
            >Family Library Sharing</a
        >, the ban is also applied to the actual owner of the game
    </li>
</ul>

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="2"></a>Requirements</h2>
<strong>Multi-player</strong><br />
VAC depends on the game server to exclude VAC banned users from games. Thus it only works for
multi-player games and does nothing for single player games.<br />
<br />
<strong>VAC requires the Steamworks authentication APIs</strong><br />
Authentication must be enforced in the game client and server via the
<a href="/doc/features/auth">Steam Authentication APIs</a>.<br />
<br />
<strong>Enable Anti-Cheat APIs</strong><br />
This can be done from the
<a href="/apps/vac/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Anti-Cheat Configuration</a> page in the App
Admin panel. These APIs must be enabled to apply Game bans and for VAC to detect cheats in your
app.<br />
<br />
<strong>An active developer looking for cheats</strong><br />
VAC only attempts to detect cheats reported by the developer. Valve does not actively seek out
cheats either automatically or through manual digging. Please report cheats by using the
<a href="/doc/webapi/ICheatReportingService#ReportCheatData"
    >ICheatReportingService/ReportCheatData</a
>
Web API and with a notification to
<a href="mailto:valveanticheat@valvesoftware.com">valveanticheat@valvesoftware.com</a> so that we
can characterize them and include them in our cheat detection.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="3"></a>Secure game servers</h2>
A "secure" game is one that doesn't allow convicted cheaters to play on it. Individual instances of
your game can choose at run-time whether or not they are secure or insecure. It's up to your game to
choose the policy on this, but typically games default to being secure with an option to let the
user start the game as insecure. This separates the cheaters from the rest of your community while
still letting them play the game. Only users connected to a secure server will be scanned for
cheats.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="4"></a>Integration</h2>
VAC cheat detection is independent of your game client; that work is done by Steam. The game should
use best practices and protect its assets and internal state. The game needs to use the
<a href="/doc/api">Steamworks API</a> to find out whether or not a user is VAC banned. There are 3
results returned in the
<a href="/doc/api/ISteamUser#ValidateAuthTicketResponse_t"
    >ISteamUser::ValidateAuthTicketResponse_t</a
>
callback from <a href="/doc/api/ISteamUser#BeginAuthSession">ISteamUser::BeginAuthSession</a> that
are specific to VAC. The VAC specific authentication results are:<br />
<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="/doc/api/steam_api#k_EAuthSessionResponseVACBanned"
            >k_EAuthSessionResponseVACBanned</a
        >
        - Returned when the player is VAC banned for cheating.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="/doc/api/steam_api#k_EAuthSessionResponseVACCheckTimedOut"
            >k_EAuthSessionResponseVACCheckTimedOut</a
        >
        - Returned when the players system is not allowing VAC to scan for cheats, and the player
        should be kicked from the game when this happens.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="/doc/api/steam_api#k_EAuthSessionResponsePublisherIssuedBan"
            >k_EAuthSessionResponsePublisherIssuedBan</a
        >
        - Returned when the user is banned via the RequestPlayerGameBan webapi.
    </li>
</ul>
