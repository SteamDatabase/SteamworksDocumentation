<h1>VAC Integration</h1>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Goals and methodology</h2>
The goal of VAC is to strongly discourage users from using cheat software by
both having strong penalties if a user is caught cheating, and by making it hard
for the cheating community to know if a cheat is actively being detected. VAC is
a component of Steamworks and the Steam client, and works by scanning the users
system for cheats while your game is running. It works a lot like a virus
scanner, and has a database of known cheats to detect. Once a cheat has been
detected, the user's account is marked for a delayed ban. A ban doesn't take
effect immediately and instead is enforced a few days after the cheats are
detected. Once a user ban is in effect, the user will no longer be able to
connect to multi-player game servers that are marked as secure. Bans are tied to
a user's account, so the only way for the user get un-banned is by creating a
new Steam account, and buying another copy of the game.<br /><br />When a user
is VAC Banned, the following happens:<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
  <li>
    The account cannot join secure servers for the AppIDs they are banned<br />
  </li>
  <li>The ban is publicly displayed on their Steam Community profile<br /></li>
  <li>The account can no longer share VAC enabled games<br /></li>
  <li>
    If the user is borrowing the game via

    >, the ban is also applied to the actual owner of the game
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="2"></a>Requirements</h2>
<strong>Multi-player</strong><br />VAC depends on the game server to exclude VAC
banned users from games. Thus it only works for multi-player games and does
nothing for single player games.<br /><br /><strong
  >VAC requires the Steamworks authentication APIs</strong
><br />Authentication must be enforced in the game client and server via the
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/features/auth" class="bb_doclink"
  >Steam Authentication APIs</a
>.<br /><br /><strong>An active developer looking for cheats</strong><br />VAC
only attempts to detect cheats reported by the developer. Valve does not
actively seek out cheats either automatically or through manual digging. Please
report cheats by using the
<a
  href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/webapi/ICheatReportingService#ReportCheatData"
  class="bb_apilink"
  >ICheatReportingService/ReportCheatData</a
>
Web API and with a notification to
<a href="mailto:valveanticheat@valvesoftware.com"
  >valveanticheat@valvesoftware.com</a
>
so that we can characterize them and include them in our cheat detection.<br /><br /><strong
  >Opting into VAC</strong
><br />This can be done from the

page in the App Admin panel.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="3"></a>Secure game servers</h2>
A "secure" game is one that doesn't allow convicted cheaters to play on it.
Individual instances of your game can choose at run-time whether or not they are
secure or insecure. It's up to your game to choose the policy on this, but
typically games default to being secure with an option to let the user start the
game as insecure. This separates the cheaters from the rest of your community
while still letting them play the game. Only users connected to a secure server
will be scanned for cheats.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="4"></a>Integration</h2>
VAC cheat detection is independent of your game client; that work is done by
Steam. The game should use best practices and protect its assets and internal
state. The game needs to use the
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api" class="bb_doclink"
  >Steamworks API</a
>
to find out whether or not a user is VAC banned. There are 3 results returned in
the

<a
  href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamUser#BeginAuthSession"

    - Returned when the players system is not allowing VAC to scan for cheats,
    and the player should be kicked from the game when this happens.<br />
