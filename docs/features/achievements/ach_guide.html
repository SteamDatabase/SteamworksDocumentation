<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Introduction</h2>
Achievements can be used as a way to encourage and reward player interactions and milestones within
your game. They are often used for marking number of kills, miles driven, chests opened or other
common actions within your game. And they can also be used to help your players discover different
ways of playing your game. When unlocked, these achievements will pop up in the corner of the
players' window and will be marked within an achievement page for that player.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="2"></a>Technical Overview</h2>
The following is a quick step by step guide to integrating very basic Steam Achievements into your
application in under 10 minutes and under 10 lines of code integrated into your code base. The
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/sdk" class="bb_doclink">Steamworks SDK</a> comes with a
great example application called
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/sdk/api/example" class="bb_doclink">Spacewar</a> that
shows off the full breadth of Steam features and should be your first stop to see all Steam features
in action. This tutorial distills the information found in Spacewar and the Stats and Achievements
API down to just the necessary information required for Steam Stats to keep things as
straightforward as possible. Please note that there is a considerable amount of overlap between
stats and achievements, as such if you are integrating both be aware that a lot of calls can be
consolidated.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="3"></a>Step 1 - Defining your game's Achievements</h2>
Achievements are application specific and are setup on the
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/apps/achievements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
    >Achievement Configuration</a
>
page in the Steamworks App Admin backend. The following is the list of achievements from the
Steamworks sample app Spacewar:<br /><img
    src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/spacewar_achievements.png"
    alt="spacewar_achievements.png"
    title="spacewar_achievements.png"
/>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="4"></a>Step 2 - Encapsulating Achievements work</h2>
The following code is game independent and can be added to your game as you see fit. The class is
fully functional as is but can be easily extended to meet any further needs. All of this code was
taken directly from the Spacewar example files
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">StatsAndAchievements.cpp/h</code>.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="5"></a>Header File</h2>
We first define a structure to hold our achievement data received from steam and provide a macro for
creating objects of that type. This data maps directly to what is found on the
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/apps/achievements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
    >Achievement Configuration</a
>
page.<br />
<div class="bb_code cpp">
    #define _ACH_ID( id, name ) { id, #id, name, "", 0, 0 } struct Achievement_t { int
    m_eAchievementID; const char *m_pchAchievementID; char m_rgchName[128]; char
    m_rgchDescription[256]; bool m_bAchieved; int m_iIconImage; };
</div>
<br />Next we define a helper class that will wrap all of the Steam Stats API calls as well as
creating all of the
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/sdk/api#callbacks" class="bb_doclink">Steam callbacks</a
>.<br />
<div class="bb_code cpp">
    class CSteamAchievements { private: int64 m_iAppID; // Our current AppID Achievement_t
    *m_pAchievements; // Achievements data int m_iNumAchievements; // The number of Achievements
    bool m_bInitialized; // Have we called Request stats and received the callback? public:
    CSteamAchievements(Achievement_t *Achievements, int NumAchievements); ~CSteamAchievements();
    bool RequestStats(); bool SetAchievement(const char* ID); STEAM_CALLBACK( CSteamAchievements,
    OnUserStatsReceived, UserStatsReceived_t, m_CallbackUserStatsReceived ); STEAM_CALLBACK(
    CSteamAchievements, OnUserStatsStored, UserStatsStored_t, m_CallbackUserStatsStored );
    STEAM_CALLBACK( CSteamAchievements, OnAchievementStored, UserAchievementStored_t,
    m_CallbackAchievementStored ); };
</div>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="6"></a>Code File</h2>
<h4>Constructor</h4>
<strong>Parameters</strong> - The constructor takes a pointer to an array of achievements along with
the length of the array. The formating of that array will be covered in the main game code later.<br /><strong
    >Returns</strong
>
- N/A<br /><strong>What it does</strong> - The constructor initializes a number of members along
with grabbing the AppID we are currently running as. In addition it hooks up the call back methods
to handle asynchronous calls made to Steam. Finally it makes an initial call to
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">RequestStats()</code> to get stats and achievements
for the current user.<br />
<div class="bb_code cpp">
    CSteamAchievements::CSteamAchievements(Achievement_t *Achievements, int NumAchievements):
    m_iAppID( 0 ), m_bInitialized( false ), m_CallbackUserStatsReceived( this,
    &amp;CSteamAchievements::OnUserStatsReceived ), m_CallbackUserStatsStored( this,
    &amp;CSteamAchievements::OnUserStatsStored ), m_CallbackAchievementStored( this,
    &amp;CSteamAchievements::OnAchievementStored ) { m_iAppID = SteamUtils()-&gt;GetAppID();
    m_pAchievements = Achievements; m_iNumAchievements = NumAchievements; RequestStats(); }
</div>
<h4>RequestStats()</h4>
<strong>Parameters</strong> - None<br /><strong>Returns</strong> - a bool representing if the call
succeeded or not. If the call failed then most likely Steam is not initialized. Make sure you have a
steam client open when you try to make this call and that
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/steam_api#SteamAPI_Init" class="bb_apilink"
    >SteamAPI_Init</a
>
has been called before it.<br /><strong>What it does</strong> - This method basically wraps a call
to
<a
    href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamUserStats#RequestCurrentStats"
    class="bb_apilink"
    >ISteamUserStats::RequestCurrentStats</a
>
which is an asynchronous call to steam requesting the stats and achievements of the current user.
This call needs to be made before you can set any stats or achievements. The initial call to this
method is made in the constructor. You can call it again any time after that if you want to check on
updated stats or achievements.<br />
<div class="bb_code">
    bool CSteamAchievements::RequestStats() { // Is Steam loaded? If not we can't get stats. if (
    NULL == SteamUserStats() || NULL == SteamUser() ) { return false; } // Is the user logged on? If
    not we can't get stats. if ( !SteamUser()-&gt;BLoggedOn() ) { return false; } // Request user
    stats. return SteamUserStats()-&gt;RequestCurrentStats(); }
</div>
<h4>SetAchievement()</h4>
<strong>Parameters</strong> - The string identifier of the Achievement that you want to set (ie.
"ACH_WIN_ONE_GAME")<br /><strong>Returns</strong> - a bool representing if the call succeeded or
not. If the call failed then either Steam is not initialized or you still haven't processed the
callback from the initial call to
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">RequestStats</code>. You can't set any achievements
until that callback has been received.<br /><strong>What it does</strong> - This method sets a given
achievement to achieved and sends the results to Steam. You can set a given achievement multiple
times so you don't need to worry about only setting achievements that aren't already set. This is an
asynchronous call which will trigger two callbacks:
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">OnUserStatsStored()</code> and
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">OnAchievementStored()</code>.<br />
<div class="bb_code cpp">
    bool CSteamAchievements::SetAchievement(const char* ID) { // Have we received a call back from
    Steam yet? if (m_bInitialized) { SteamUserStats()-&gt;SetAchievement(ID); return
    SteamUserStats()-&gt;StoreStats(); } // If not then we can't set achievements yet return false;
    }
</div>
<h4>OnUserStatsReceived()</h4>
<strong>Parameters</strong> - N/A<br /><strong>Returns</strong> - Nothing<br /><strong
    >What it does</strong
>
- This method is a callback that is called anytime you attempt to request stats. Stats and
achievements are requested by using
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">RequestStats()</code>. The method updates the
member variable m_pAchievements to reflect the latest stats and achievement data returned from
Steam.<br />
<div class="bb_code cpp">
    void CSteamAchievements::OnUserStatsReceived( UserStatsReceived_t *pCallback ) { // we may get
    callbacks for other games' stats arriving, ignore them if ( m_iAppID == pCallback-&gt;m_nGameID
    ) { if ( k_EResultOK == pCallback-&gt;m_eResult ) { OutputDebugString("Received stats and
    achievements from Steam\n"); m_bInitialized = true; // load achievements for ( int iAch = 0;
    iAch &lt; m_iNumAchievements; ++iAch ) { Achievement_t &amp;ach = m_pAchievements[iAch];
    SteamUserStats()-&gt;GetAchievement(ach.m_pchAchievementID, &amp;ach.m_bAchieved); _snprintf(
    ach.m_rgchName, sizeof(ach.m_rgchName), "%s",
    SteamUserStats()-&gt;GetAchievementDisplayAttribute(ach.m_pchAchievementID, "name")); _snprintf(
    ach.m_rgchDescription, sizeof(ach.m_rgchDescription), "%s",
    SteamUserStats()-&gt;GetAchievementDisplayAttribute(ach.m_pchAchievementID, "desc")); } } else {
    char buffer[128]; _snprintf( buffer, 128, "RequestStats - failed, %d\n", pCallback-&gt;m_eResult
    ); OutputDebugString( buffer ); } } }
</div>
<h4>OnUserStatsStored()</h4>
<strong>Parameters</strong> - N/A<br /><strong>Returns</strong> - Nothing<br /><strong
    >What it does</strong
>
- This method is a callback that is called anytime you attempt to store stats on Steam.<br />
<div class="bb_code cpp">
    void CSteamAchievements::OnUserStatsStored( UserStatsStored_t *pCallback ) { // we may get
    callbacks for other games' stats arriving, ignore them if ( m_iAppID == pCallback-&gt;m_nGameID
    ) { if ( k_EResultOK == pCallback-&gt;m_eResult ) { OutputDebugString( "Stored stats for
    Steam\n" ); } else { char buffer[128]; _snprintf( buffer, 128, "StatsStored - failed, %d\n",
    pCallback-&gt;m_eResult ); OutputDebugString( buffer ); } } }
</div>
<h4>OnAchievementStored()</h4>
<strong>Parameters</strong> - N/A<br /><strong>Returns</strong> - Nothing<br /><strong
    >What it does</strong
>
- This method is a callback that is called anytime Achievements are successfully stored on Steam.<br />
<div class="bb_code cpp">
    void CSteamAchievements::OnAchievementStored( UserAchievementStored_t *pCallback ) { // we may
    get callbacks for other games' stats arriving, ignore them if ( m_iAppID ==
    pCallback-&gt;m_nGameID ) { OutputDebugString( "Stored Achievement for Steam\n" ); } }
</div>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="7"></a>Step 3 - Integrating into your game</h2>
The following is a complete listing of code snippets that you would need to integrate into your game
in the appropriate locations.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="8"></a>Defines and Globals</h2>
The following is the list of includes that are needed to build with Achievements, an enum of our
game specific achievements and a global pointer to our helper object. Please note that the
achievements match those of the Admin page on Steamworks.<br />
<div class="bb_code cpp">
    ... #include "steam_api.h" // Defining our achievements enum EAchievements { ACH_WIN_ONE_GAME =
    0, ACH_WIN_100_GAMES = 1, ACH_TRAVEL_FAR_ACCUM = 2, ACH_TRAVEL_FAR_SINGLE = 3, }; // Achievement
    array which will hold data about the achievements and their state Achievement_t g_Achievements[]
    = { _ACH_ID( ACH_WIN_ONE_GAME, "Winner" ), _ACH_ID( ACH_WIN_100_GAMES, "Champion" ), _ACH_ID(
    ACH_TRAVEL_FAR_ACCUM, "Interstellar" ), _ACH_ID( ACH_TRAVEL_FAR_SINGLE, "Orbiter" ), }; //
    Global access to Achievements object CSteamAchievements* g_SteamAchievements = NULL; ...
</div>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="9"></a>Initialization</h2>
The call to
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/steam_api#SteamAPI_Init" class="bb_apilink"
    >SteamAPI_Init</a
>
initializes all of Steam and must be called before anything else. If that call succeeds then we
create the helper object by passing in the array of achievements along with the size of the
array.<br />
<div class="bb_code cpp">
    ... // Initialize Steam bool bRet = SteamAPI_Init(); // Create the SteamAchievements object if
    Steam was successfully initialized if (bRet) { g_SteamAchievements = new
    CSteamAchievements(g_Achievements, 4); } ...
</div>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="10"></a>Processing Callbacks</h2>
To ensure that we process all Steam callbacks we need to regularly pump for new messages. This is
achieved by adding this call to the game loop.<br />
<div class="bb_code cpp">... SteamAPI_RunCallbacks(); ...</div>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="11"></a>Triggering Achievements</h2>
Triggering an achievement is as simple as a single call passing along the achievement identifier.<br />
<div class="bb_code cpp">
    ... if (g_SteamAchievements) g_SteamAchievements-&gt;SetAchievement("ACH_WIN_100_GAMES"); ...
</div>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="12"></a>Shutdown</h2>
The call to
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/steam_api#SteamAPI_Shutdown" class="bb_apilink"
    >SteamAPI_Shutdown</a
>
is probably something you already have in your code. It shuts down steam and must be called before
you application exits. Finally we delete the helper object we created.<br />
<div class="bb_code cpp">
    ... // Shutdown Steam SteamAPI_Shutdown(); // Delete the SteamAchievements object if
    (g_SteamAchievements) delete g_SteamAchievements; ...
</div>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="13"></a>Step 4 - Testing and Troubleshooting</h2>
<br />To set or clear stats or an achievement without adding code to your game, you can use the
Steam client console. Run with steam.exe -console, then:<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>achievement_clear &lt;appid&gt; &lt;achievement name&gt;<br /></li>
    <li>reset_all_stats &lt;appid&gt;</li>
</ul>
