<h1>Steam Curators, Featuring List in 2017 Steam Winter Sale</h1>
During the 2017 Steam Winter Sale, Steam Curators will be able to select a list to feature to their
followers. Here is more information for Steam Curators wishing to participate.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="1"></a>What kind of list to feature</h2>
The list you choose to feature is up to you. You can pick from one of your existing lists or create
a new list specifically for this purpose.<br />
<br />
It may be useful to think about what kind of list your followers are likely to be most interested
in. It could be a list of your favorite new releases from the past year or a list of best deals
during the 2017 Winter Sale. Or the list could be around a particular genre or theme or interest.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="2"></a>How to select a list to feature</h2>
All functionality for Steam Curators has been moved to a new "admin" section that you can access
from your Curator store page. As long as you are signed in with a Steam account with permission to
post curator reviews, you'll see an 'admin' tab on your Curator page in the Steam store.<br />

        Then from that left-side menu pick "Create a new list" or the "Manage lists" and select one
        of your lists to edit.<br />

<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="4"></a>FAQ</h2>
<strong>Q. Can I feature a list prior to the winter sale?</strong><br />
You can select a list to feature, but it will not appear in the new featured spot until the sale
begins.<br />
<br />
<strong>Q. Does a featured list also appear on my Curator home page?</strong><br />
Yes, a featured list is also considered public, and will appear in the other places where lists
normally appear.<br />
<br />
<strong>Q. What happens to a featured list after the Winter Sale is over?</strong><br />
Featured lists will automatically switch to being marked as public. If you wish to remove a featured
list after the sale, you will need to delete the list or set as hidden yourself.
