<h1>Steam Families</h1>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Overview</h2>
The Steam Families feature allows Steam users to play games from up to five close family members
libraries. For more information about the feature, please see our

By default Family Sharing is enabled on all games and DLC on Steam. For the most part, this feature
doesn't require any extra implementation by the developer, but in some cases the game needs to be
aware that the current player is using a shared copy. One example would be if your game economy is
impacted if a DLC includes items or currency that are meant to be used only once. Or if you
implement your own banning system (that's not VAC), you may need to verify game ownership in case
both the player and the original game owner need to be banned for malicious behavior in a game.<br />
<br />
There are two ways to check if a game is being accessed via Family Sharing, client-side or server
side.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="2"></a>Checking Family Sharing status via Client API</h2>
<br />
Your running game can call
<a href="/doc/api/ISteamApps#BIsSubscribedFromFamilySharing"
    >ISteamApps::BIsSubscribedFromFamilySharing</a
>
to check if the game is accessed via family sharing. If the user is playing a shared copy, call
<a href="/doc/api/ISteamApps#GetAppOwner">ISteamApps::GetAppOwner</a> to get the SteamID of the
original game owner.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="3"></a>Checking Family Sharing status via Server API</h2>
<br />
A more secure way to check if a player is using a shared copy is to call the
<a href="/doc/webapi/ISteamUser#CheckAppOwnership">ISteamUser/CheckAppOwnership</a> Web API method
from your backend. If the user is playing a shared copy, the response field "permanent" will be set
to false and the field "ownersteamid" will contain the original owners SteamID, different from the
caller provided SteamID. Family sharing licenses are considered temporary and family members
accessing a shared game shouldn't be granted any permanent ownership rights on your backend.<br />
<br />
