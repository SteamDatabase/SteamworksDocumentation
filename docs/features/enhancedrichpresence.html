<h1>Enhanced Rich Presence</h1>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Overview</h2>
With the recent release of the new Steam Friends and Chat client we've enhanced the capabilities of
our rich presence system to show more about the games being played. We see a player's rich presence
as a way to engage the player's friends in their activity. For example, friends who own the game
engage by knowing the right time to join the game or by talking about it with the player, and those
who don't own the game may have their interest piqued by coming across a variety of rich presence
strings that tell them more about a game that they don't know much about.<br /><br /><img

/><br /><br />In this documentation, we’re going to cover two settings you can define to control how
your game appears in players’ friends list: <br />
<ul class="bb_ul ">
    <li>
        Rich Presence String – used for displaying information about player state in your game that
        their friends may want to know<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Friend Grouping – used for grouping friends together that are playing together in the game
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="2"></a>Game controlled Rich Presence string</h2>

    alt="Friends can see more information about games at a glance"
    title="Friends can see more information about games at a glance"
/><br />The system in place is customizable so that your team can determine which information is the
most interesting to a player's friends. <br />Your game will have its own specific data that will be
the right information to show with enhanced rich presence. To start you off, though, here are some
thoughts to consider:
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="multiplayer"></a>Multiplayer Games</h2>
Depending on the multiplayer game type, information that helps a player's friends know when to jump
in can vary. Some games are played in rounds that are determined by time, or by players remaining,
and so that information is most useful to display. Other multiplayer games are finished once an
objective is met and showing progression towards that goal can be useful. Knowing which game mode or
map your player is on can also be useful in helping the player's friends make a decision on how to
engage with the player.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="singleplayer"></a>Single-player Games</h2>
While single-player games are not joined by a player's friends, friend engagement can still occur if
the information shown causes the friend to watch the player play, talk to them about strategies, or
talk about highlights of playing. Information showing the zone, chapter, or level the player is in,
or what the player is currently doing in the game can help achieve these goals.<br /><br /><strong

    >Examples of data to show if applicable</strong
><br />
<ul class="bb_ul ">
    <li>Time remaining<br /></li>
    <li>Time passed<br /></li>
    <li>Players still alive<br /></li>
    <li>Map or Zone name<br /></li>
    <li>Player level<br /></li>
    <li>Player Class<br /></li>
    <li>Game score<br /></li>
    <li>Difficulty<br /></li>
    <li>Game mode type<br /></li>
    <li>Spots open on the server<br /></li>
    <li>Action being taken (deck building, roster changing, on main menu etc.)</li>
</ul>
<div class="bb_callout ">
    <div>
        <strong>NOTE:</strong> Keep in mind that this rich presence string will need to fit on one
        line, and is shown under a players name in the friends list. If it is too long, the end of
        the line will be truncated or ellipsized.
    </div>
</div>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="3"></a>Friend Grouping</h2>
<br />Along with the additional line of information, the new Friends List is able to display groups
of friends who are playing together. Those friends who are in a party, server, or match together
will be grouped under the game category with a line connecting them together. The way the grouping
is determined will depend on your game and what makes the most sense to show. For example, in Dota 2
there are parties of up to 5 people, so we will show the party that is being played with, not the
full team of 5 that is match-made by the game. In Counter-Strike, though, 2 friends may be playing
on a server together, but rather than showing the whole server as part of the party, only the mutual
friends who are playing together are placed in the same Steam Player Group.<br /><br /><img

/><br /><br /><strong><code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">*</code></strong> To define
the grouping of players in the Steam friends list and chat, set the
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">steam_player_group</code> and

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="4"></a>Steam API &amp; Localization</h2>
<ul class="bb_ul ">
    <li>
        Information about the Steam API calls to set your new rich presence strings, documentation
        can be found here:
        <a
            href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamFriends#SetRichPresence"

        >
        <br /><br />
    </li>
    <li>
        As enhanced rich presence can now show strings relating to each game, localization is
        necessary so that players running in all supported languages can view the information. More
        information on how that is setup can be found here: <br /><a
            href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamFriends#richpresencelocalization"

    </li>
    <li>
        <strong
            >Once you have hooked up the data appropriately, run the game and make sure you are
            logged into the Steam on the web and then you can test to see if it's working and what
            will be displayed here: <br /><a
                href="https://steamcommunity.com/dev/testrichpresence"
                target="_blank"
                rel="noreferrer"

            ></strong
        >
    </li>
</ul>
<br /><br />Below is a code sample to show how simple it is to set this up.<br /><br /><strong
    ><i>Code Snippet</i></strong
><br />
<div class="bb_code ">
    /*--------------------------- SAMPLE -------------------*/ const char *pchStatus; if ( bWinning
    &amp;&amp; cWinners &gt; 1 ) { pchStatus = "Tied"; } else if ( bWinning ) { pchStatus =
    "Winning"; } else { pchStatus = "Losing"; } SteamFriends()-&gt;SetRichPresence( "gamestatus",
    pchStatus ); bool bDisplayScoreInRichPresence = true; if ( bDisplayScoreInRichPresence ) { char
    rgchBuffer[32]; sprintf_safe( rgchBuffer, "%2u", uMyScore ); SteamFriends()-&gt;SetRichPresence(
    "score", rgchBuffer ); } SteamFriends()-&gt;SetRichPresence( "steam_display",
    bDisplayScoreInRichPresence ? "#StatusWithScore" : "#StatusWithoutScore" ); // Sample of
    grouping friends together when they play together if ( nPartyMemberCount &gt; 1 &amp;&amp;
    strPartyID ) { // If we're in a party of more than one user, and we have a valid PartyID then //
    inform Steam's Rich Presence system. steamapicontext-&gt;SteamFriends()-&gt;SetRichPresence(
    "steam_player_group", strPartyID ); steamapicontext-&gt;SteamFriends()-&gt;SetRichPresence(
    "steam_player_group_size", CNumStr( nPartyMemberCount ) ); } else { // Otherwise, clear out
    whatever information we had there before; we're not in a party.
    steamapicontext-&gt;SteamFriends()-&gt;SetRichPresence( "steam_player_group", nullptr );
    steamapicontext-&gt;SteamFriends()-&gt;SetRichPresence( "steam_player_group_size", nullptr ); }
</div>
<br />The above code uses localization that includes English tokens like the following:<br /><br />
<div class="bb_code ">
    "lang" { "language" "english" "tokens" { "#StatusWithoutScore" "{#Status_%gamestatus%}"
    "#StatusWithScore" "{#Status_%gamestatus%}: %SCORE%" "#Status_AtMainMenu" "At the main menu"
    "#Status_WaitingForMatch" "Waiting for match" "#Status_Winning" "Winning" "#Status_Losing"
    "Losing" "#Status_Tied" "Tied" } }
</div>
