<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Overview</h2>
If Steam error reporting is implemented then Steam will automatically upload mini dumps of any
exception after 10 similar exceptions are thrown.<br />
<br />
You can view the details of each crash on the
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Error Reports</a>
page of the Steamworks Partner backend.<br />
<br />
Mini-dumps are always stored locally on the computer before they are uploaded to Steam. If you need
to examine one directly, you should be able to find it in the games install directory.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="2"></a>How to Implement</h2>
Steam error reporting is easy to use if you're already using

    >Structured Exception Handling</a
>.<br />
<br />
You must hook up the Win32
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/5z4bw5h5.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
    >_set_se_translator</a
>
function which calls a function you create to handle the minidump. In that function you can use
<a
    href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/steam_api#SteamAPI_SetMiniDumpComment"
    class="bb_apilink"
    >SteamAPI_SetMiniDumpComment</a
>
and
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/steam_api#SteamAPI_WriteMiniDump" class="bb_apilink"
    >SteamAPI_WriteMiniDump</a
>
to notify Steam about the impending crash.

<div class="bb_code cpp">
    #ifdef _WIN32 #include &lt;Windows.h&gt; void MiniDumpFunction( unsigned int nExceptionCode,
    EXCEPTION_POINTERS *pException ) { // You can build and set an arbitrary comment to embed in the
    minidump here, // maybe you want to put what level the user was playing, how many players on the
    server, // how much memory is free, etc... SteamAPI_SetMiniDumpComment( "Minidump comment:
    SteamworksExample.exe/n" ); // The 0 here is a build ID, we don't set it SteamAPI_WriteMiniDump(
    nExceptionCode, pException, 0 ); } int RealMain( HINSTANCE hInstance, LPSTR lpCmdLine, int
    nCmdShow ) { __debugbreak(); return 0; } int APIENTRY WinMain( HINSTANCE hInstance, HINSTANCE
    hPrevInstance, LPSTR lpCmdLine, int nCmdShow ) { // All we do here is call the real main
    function after setting up our se translator // this allows us to catch exceptions and report
    errors to Steam. // // Note that you must set your compiler flags correctly to enable structured
    exception // handling in order for this particular setup method to work. if (
    IsDebuggerPresent() ) { // We don't want to mask exceptions (or report them to Steam!) when
    debugging. // If you would like to step through the exception handler, attach a debugger //
    after running the game outside of the debugger. return RealMain( lpCmdLine, hInstance, nCmdShow
    ); } _set_se_translator( MiniDumpFunction ); try // this try block allows the SE translator to
    work { return RealMain( hInstance, lpCmdLine, nCmdShow ); } catch( ... ) { return -1; } } #endif

The error reporting API currently only supports 32-bit applications on Windows.
