<h1>TradeSetOwned/v0001</h1>
This is called when the Steam Economy Server needs to transfer an asset or chunk of currency that
was previously set unowned to a user's inventory. It is up to the asset server to verify that this
is a legal change to make to this asset or currency type. It should check asset ownership is
actually unowned, that the asset or currency is tradable, and that the requested amount is
present.<br />
<br />
For stackable assets and currency it is possible that this request will provide an amount that is
fewer than was originally set unowned. In that case the unowned asset or currency should have its
amount decremented and a new asset should be created.<br />
<br />
This will happen if you have a stackable item that can be listed on the Community Market. For
example, if somebody puts a large stack of items on the market in a single listing, then multiple
smaller purchases may come in.<br />
<br />
The asset server will receive one
<a href="/doc/features/inventory/economy/TradeSetUnowned">TradeSetUnowned</a> call when the listing
is created, and then one <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">TradeSetOwned</code> call
for each purchase. When someone makes the first purchase for the listing on the market, the
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">audit_reference</code> value in the
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">TradeSetOwned</code> call will match the
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">audit_reference</code> value from the
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">TradeSetUnowned</code> call. Further purchases of
that listing will all have different values for
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">audit_reference</code>, but will still refer to the
same <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">assetid</code>. If the listing is canceled,
the value of <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">audit_reference</code> in the
resulting <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">TradeSetOwned</code> call will be a value
that has not previously been used in any other
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">TradeSetOwned</code> calls and thus is not
guaranteed to match the value was used in the
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">TradeSetUnowned</code> call when the listing was
created.<br />

                transfers. This<br />
                could be a new asset ID or be the same as the asset id specified in the request
                depending on the implementation of the asset server.<br />

                <strong>NOTE:</strong> For auditing purposes, we recommend that asset server
                implementations create a new copy of the asset and return the new asset ID in the
                TradeSetOwned response. We have found that this also helps prevent bugs as it means
                once an asset is deleted/unowned, it remains in that state forever. Tracking that
                there is a link between the new and old assets (for example, by preserving some
                "original asset ID" from when the asset was first created in your game) may also
                prove useful. None of this is required, it's just something we've found to be
                useful.<br />

                could be a different context ID or be the same as the context id specified in the
