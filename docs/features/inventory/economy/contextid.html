<h1>Steam Economy Context IDs</h1>
Each asset in the Steam Economy can be uniquely identified by the combination of three numbers: App
ID, Context ID, and Asset ID. It is up to each game to determine what the 64-bit context ID means
for its assets. Depending on the style of game this will probably take one of a few different forms.
In any case, Steam doesn't care what the values of a context ID actually are. The only requirement
is that stay the same for the same logical context (server, character, container, etc.) so that
audit records will continue to be accurate and so
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">GetAssetDetails</code> will continue to work for
those assets.<br />
<br />
Steam reserves the top two bits of each context ID for its own use. Context IDs returned by an asset
server must be zero in the top two bits.<br />
<br />
All contexts defined by the asset server must also have a non-zero context ID. APIs that return
context IDs must not specify a value of zero.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="1"></a>Game-wide Inventory</h2>
Some games have a single inventory per user and no concept of a persistent character that is
distinct from the user's account. Those games may only have one context per account to represent all
items owned by that account. They may also declare some contexts that contain other types of assets
or contexts that aren't user-visible at all just to expose some internal data in the support
tool.<br />

<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="2"></a>Per-Character Inventory</h2>
In some games each account can have multiple characters and each character can have multiple
inventories. One context item scheme that can be used in these games is to break up the context ID
into a 32-bit (with two reserved) character ID and a 32-bit container ID inside that character. If
your game has globally unique 32-bit character IDs internally, your game can use those directly in
the context ID.<br />

<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="3"></a>Characters on a Shard</h2>
Some games have characters that are tied to a specific server and then multiple inventories per
character. This pattern is common in MMOs. One way to partition context IDs for this sort of setup
would be to use the high 16 bits (with two reserved) for server ID, 32 bits for character ID, and 16
bits for container ID. (Zeros omitted from the diagram for the sake of brevity.)<br />
