                        those identifiers are. They just need to provide enough information to
                        reproduce the asset info (i.e. describe what kind of item it is) when the
                        class identifiers are passed back into
                        <a href="/doc/features/inventory/economy/GetAssetClassInfo"

                                value of this part of the class identifier as a string.<br />
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">instance</code> -
                                If this is true the class identifier is considered "instance data",
                                which means that it generally doesn't transfer with the item on a
                                trade, and so it doesn't factor into the trade value of the item.

                                response should never be considered instance data. The Community
                                Market depends on instance properties not having any effect on the
                                <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight"
                                    >market_hash_name</code

                        To maximize the amount of description information that Steam can cache, the
                        class identifiers should be as generic and reusable as possible. For
                        example, avoid a class where you just have one property with a name like
                        "itemid" and a value that's the 64-bit ID of the asset. Instead, describe
                        what kind of item it is in a way that gives you enough information to build
                        the description. For example, an asset class of "type" = "sword" and
                        "rarity" = "common" gives you enough information to build the item's
                        description without having to know exactly which instance of the item it
                        is.<br />
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">amount</code> (optional) -
                        The stack count for this asset. The user will be able to trade up to this
                        number of units out of this stack. (Default: 1)<br />
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">currency</code> (optional) - An
                array of the currency types this context contains. If a user has none of a
                particular kind of currency it should only be included here if it would be visible
                on in-game UI. The display of currency is very similar to that of an asset, so the
                fields listed above for assets also apply to currency, with the exception of the
                <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">class</code> and
                <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">id</code> fields. In addition to
                the other asset fields, the following two fields are used for currency:<br />
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">id</code> - The unsigned
                        32-bit ID assigned to this kind of currency. This ID must be globally unique
                        within the game.<br />
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">amount</code> - 64-bit
                        integer representing the amount of this kind of currency that is owned by
                        the user.<br />
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
