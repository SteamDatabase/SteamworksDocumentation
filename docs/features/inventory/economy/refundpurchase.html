<h1>RefundPurchase/v0001</h1>
This is called by Steam after a user has submitted their refund request and it was approved by Steam Support. Implementations should remove the purchased items from the user's account. This will usually only be called once per refund request, but it is possible that this will be called more than once for the same purchase, if, for example, Steam failed to read the response the first time it made the call. Implementations should work in such a way that both calls succeed.<br><br><strong>Called by:</strong> Steam Refunds<br><br><strong>HTTP Method:</strong> POST<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Parameters:</h2><table>  <tr><th>Name</th><th>Type</th><th>Required</th><th>Description</th></tr>  <tr><td><strong>key</strong></td><td>string</td><td>✔</td><td>This is the "Asset Server Key" that you provided in your app's Steam Economy Settings on the partner site.</td></tr>  <tr><td><strong>appid</strong></td><td>uint32</td><td>✔</td><td>32bit App ID of the application associated with the purchase.
