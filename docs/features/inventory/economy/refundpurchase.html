<h1>RefundPurchase/v0001</h1>
This is called by Steam after a user has submitted their refund request and it was approved by Steam
Support. Implementations should remove the purchased items from the user's account. This will
usually only be called once per refund request, but it is possible that this will be called more
than once for the same purchase, if, for example, Steam failed to read the response the first time
it made the call. Implementations should work in such a way that both calls succeed.<br />
