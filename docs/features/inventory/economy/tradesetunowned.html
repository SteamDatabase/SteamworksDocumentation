<h1>TradeSetUnowned/v0001</h1>
This is called when the Steam Economy Server needs to remove an asset or chunk of currency from a
user and change it to an unowned state. It is up to the asset server to verify that this is a legal
change to make to this asset or currency type. It should check asset ownership matches the specified
owner, that the asset or currency is tradable, and that the requested amount is present.<br />

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="2"></a>Returns</h2>
The output from this method should be encoded in the JSON format.<br />
<br />
<strong>Response:</strong><br />
<ul>
    <li>
        <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">result</code><br />
        <ul>
            <li>
                <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">success</code> - True if the method
                was successful. If the asset server is returning false, it should set
                <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">error</code> to a string that
                explains why.<br />
                <br />
                <strong>NOTE:</strong> If success is set to false or if the response is invalid or
                times out, Steam will retry the TradeSetUnowned request until it succeeds. If the
                error is a permanent failure (e.g. the item no longer exists), you should set
                <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">should_retry</code> to 0.<br />
            </li>
            <li>
                <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">should_retry</code> - By default,
                Steam will retry TradeSetUnowned calls until the request succeeds. It does this to
                make sure the item is a consistent state before deciding what to do next. However,
                for a permanent failure where you know that retries will not change the response
                (for example, if the item no longer exists), you can set the value of this field to
                0.<br />
                <br />
                You may also set this value to 1 if you wish to explicitly communicate to Steam that
                the error is a transient error (for example, you were unable to check/modify your
                database).<br />
                <br />
                This field is required because there are scenarios where the asset server might
                receive two different TradeSetUnowned requests for the same assetid, but with
                different audit_reference values. For example, a user may try to trade an item while
                simultaneously trying to list the item on the Community Market.<br />
                The asset server should accept the first TradeSetUnowned request, but then reject
                the second request since the item is no longer owned by the user. In this example,
                the response for the second request should set have should_retry set to 0 since that
                request will never succeed and has not ever succeeded.<br />
                <br />
                <strong>Important:</strong> When this value is 0, Steam assumes your asset server
                has never made any modification to this asset in response to the TradeSetUnowned
                request.<br />
                Thus, it is important that this field only be set to 0 when you are completely
                certain that the TradeSetUnowned request was not and never has been handled. Getting
                this wrong could lead to users losing items.<br />
                For example, if you have logic to handle a duplicate request and you have logic to
                check that the asset still exists, you'll want the duplicate request handling to
                occur first. Otherwise, on a repeated request, your asset server would return that
                the item no longer exists and tell Steam not to retry instead of properly returning
                the results of the previous call.<br />
            </li>
            <li>
                <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">error</code> - a string describing
                why this call failed. This message will be recorded in the error log, which is
                available under the Economy tab on the Steamworks site.<br />
            </li>
            <li>
                <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">new_assetid</code> (optional) - The
                64-bit asset ID of the unowned version of this asset. This is only set for asset
                transfers. This could be a new asset ID or be the same as the asset id specified in
                the request depending on how the implementation of the asset server.<br />
                Defaults to being the same as the asset ID that was passed in.<br />
            </li>
            <li>
                <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">new_contextid</code> (optional) -
                The 64-bit context ID of the unowned version of this asset or currency. This could
                be a different context ID or be the same as the context id specified in the request
                depending on how the implementation of the asset server. Defaults to being the same
                as the context ID that was passed in.<br />

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="3"></a>Audit Actions</h2>
This is the current list of audit actions that could be passed with this method. New audit types
could be added to this list at any time, so asset servers should be ready to deal with any unsigned
32-bit number as an audit action.<br />
<ul>
    <li>
        101 - Trade Commit - The request is part of committing a trade. audit_reference is a trade
        ID.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        102 - Trade Rollback - The request is part of rolling back a trade. audit_reference is a
        trade ID.
    </li>
</ul>
