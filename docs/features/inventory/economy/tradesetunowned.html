<h1>TradeSetUnowned/v0001</h1>
This is called when the Steam Economy Server needs to remove an asset or chunk
of currency from a user and change it to an unowned state. It is up to the asset
server to verify that this is a legal change to make to this asset or currency
type. It should check asset ownership matches the specified owner, that the
asset or currency is tradable, and that the requested amount is present.<br /><br /><strong

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="2"></a>Returns</h2>
The output from this method should be encoded in the JSON format.<br /><br /><strong
  >Response:</strong

<ul class="bb_ul">
  <li>
    <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">result</code><br />
    <ul class="bb_ul">
      <li>
        <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">success</code> - True
        if the method was successful. If the asset server is returning false, it
        should set
        <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">error</code> to a
        string that explains why.<br /><br />
        <strong>NOTE:</strong> If success is set to false or if the response is
        invalid or times out, Steam will retry the TradeSetUnowned request until
        it succeeds. If the error is a permanent failure (e.g. the item no
        longer exists), you should set
        <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">should_retry</code> to
        0.<br />
      </li>
      <li>
        <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">should_retry</code> -
        By default, Steam will retry TradeSetUnowned calls until the request
        succeeds. It does this to make sure the item is a consistent state
        before deciding what to do next. However, for a permanent failure where
        you know that retries will not change the response (for example, if the
        item no longer exists), you can set the value of this field to 0.<br /><br />
        You may also set this value to 1 if you wish to explicitly communicate
        to Steam that the error is a transient error (for example, you were
        unable to check/modify your database).<br /><br />
        This field is required because there are scenarios where the asset
        server might receive two different TradeSetUnowned requests for the same
        assetid, but with different audit_reference values. For example, a user
        may try to trade an item while simultaneously trying to list the item on
        the Community Market.<br />
        The asset server should accept the first TradeSetUnowned request, but
        then reject the second request since the item is no longer owned by the
        user. In this example, the response for the second request should set
        have should_retry set to 0 since that request will never succeed and has
        not ever succeeded.<br /><br />
        <strong>Important:</strong> When this value is 0, Steam assumes your
        asset server has never made any modification to this asset in response
        to the TradeSetUnowned request.<br />
        Thus, it is important that this field only be set to 0 when you are
        completely certain that the TradeSetUnowned request was not and never
        has been handled. Getting this wrong could lead to users losing
        items.<br />
        For example, if you have logic to handle a duplicate request and you
        have logic to check that the asset still exists, you'll want the
        duplicate request handling to occur first. Otherwise, on a repeated
        request, your asset server would return that the item no longer exists
        and tell Steam not to retry instead of properly returning the results of
        the previous call.<br />
      </li>
      <li>
        <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">error</code> - a string
        describing why this call failed. This message will be recorded in the

        site.<br />

        <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">new_assetid</code>
        (optional) - The 64-bit asset ID of the unowned version of this asset.
        This is only set for asset transfers. This could be a new asset ID or be
        the same as the asset id specified in the request depending on how the
        implementation of the asset server.<br />

        (optional) - The 64-bit context ID of the unowned version of this asset
        or currency. This could be a different context ID or be the same as the
        context id specified in the request depending on how the implementation
        of the asset server. Defaults to being the same as the context ID that
        was passed in.<br />

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="3"></a>Audit Actions</h2>
This is the current list of audit actions that could be passed with this method.
New audit types could be added to this list at any time, so asset servers should
be ready to deal with any unsigned 32-bit number as an audit action.<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
  <li>
    101 - Trade Commit - The request is part of committing a trade.
    audit_reference is a trade ID.<br />
  </li>
  <li>
    102 - Trade Rollback - The request is part of rolling back a trade.
    audit_reference is a trade ID.
  </li>
</ul>
