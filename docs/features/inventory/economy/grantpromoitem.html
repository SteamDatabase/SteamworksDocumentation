<h1>GrantPromoItem/v0001</h1>
This is an optional API to implement and it is only needed when your game is included into the Loot
Drop system. The GrantPromoItem API is called by Steam to grant an item to a user during a Steam
sale event that is participating in a Loot Drop program. <br />
<br />
The purpose is to grant a user a promotional item as a reward for participating in the event.<br />
<br />

                the asset server should return the result it returned previously with the new asset
                ID and context ID filled in.

<strong>Response:</strong><br />
<ul>
    <li>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">success</code> - True if the method
                was successful. If the asset server is returning false, it should set
                <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">error</code> to a string that
                explains why.<br />
            </li>
            <li>
                <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">error</code> - a string describing
                why this call failed. This message will be recorded in the error log, which is
                available under the Economy tab on the Steamworks site.<br />

            <li>
                <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">should_retry</code> - Required if
                success is false. Set should_retry to true if Steam should retry later. For example,
                this should be true if the failure is transient, like a SQL failure or other
                temporary backend issue on the asset server. Set to false if the error is permanent
                and Steam should give up.<br />

            <li>
                <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">new_assetid</code> - The 64-bit
