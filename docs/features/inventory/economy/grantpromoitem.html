<h1>GrantPromoItem/v0001</h1>
This is an optional API to implement and it is only needed when your game is included into the Loot Drop system. The GrantPromoItem API is called by Steam to grant an item to a user during a Steam sale event that is participating in a Loot Drop program. <br><br>The purpose is to grant a user a promotional item as a reward for participating in the event.<br><br><br><strong>Called by:</strong> Loot Drop System<br><br><strong>HTTP Method:</strong> POST<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Parameters:</h2><table>  <tr><th>Name</th><th>Type</th><th>Required</th><th>Description</th></tr>  <tr><td><strong>key</strong></td><td>string</td><td>✔</td><td>This is the "Asset Server Key" that you provided in your app's Steam Economy Settings on the partner site.</td></tr>  <tr><td><strong>owner</strong></td><td>uint64</td><td>✔</td><td>The 64-bit steam ID of the user that should receive the item.</td></tr>  <tr><td><strong>promoid</strong></td><td>uint64</td><td>✔</td><td>A 64-bit number that identifies the type of item to be granted.
