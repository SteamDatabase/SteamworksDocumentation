<h1>Steam Inventory Item Dynamic Properties</h1>
New to the Steam Inventory Service is the ability to store arbitrary string, integer, boolean, or
float properties on any item instance.<br /><br />These properties are similar to
<a
    href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/features/inventory/itemtags#PerItemTags"
    class="bb_doclink"
    >per item tags</a
>. However, unlike per item tags which are considered immutable, these properties are dynamic
because they can be modified either through a secure Web API call or through the Steamworks API.<br /><br />Also
unlike item tags, dynamic item properties are cleared when an item is traded. Dynamic item
properties are not currently visible when inspecting an item in a user's Steam Inventory or on the
Steam Community Market.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="1"></a>Retrieving Item Properties</h2>
<br />Dynamic item properties are automatically sent along with other item attributes to the Steam
Client and can be retrieved by calling
<a
    href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamInventory#GetResultItemProperty"
    class="bb_apilink"
    >ISteamInventory::GetResultItemProperty</a
>
with the property name <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">dynamic_props</code>. The
provided buffer will be filled with the string representation of the JSON for all the dynamic
properties for the item. It is up to your application to parse this string appropriately.<br /><br />For
any Web API calls that return items as JSON, the
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">dynamic_props</code> key will point to the full
JSON object containing the dynamic item properties.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="2"></a>Modifying Item Properties</h2>
<br />From one of your secure servers, you can modify items using the
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/webapi/IInventoryService#ModifyItems" class="bb_apilink"
    >IInventoryService/ModifyItems</a
>
Web API and your secure publisher key.<br /><br />You can also modify item properties from the Steam
Client via the Steamworks API and calls to
<a
    href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamInventory#StartUpdateProperties"
    class="bb_apilink"
    >ISteamInventory::StartUpdateProperties</a
>,
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamInventory#RemoveProperty" class="bb_apilink"
    >ISteamInventory::RemoveProperty</a
>,
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamInventory#SetProperty" class="bb_apilink"
    >ISteamInventory::SetProperty</a
>, and
<a
    href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamInventory#SubmitUpdateProperties"
    class="bb_apilink"
    >ISteamInventory::SubmitUpdateProperties</a
>. However, you will first need to white-list what properties can be set from the client on the
Steam Inventory Service configuration page on the partner site. We recommend that you only
white-list properties that you are fine with an untrusted client setting (i.e. the user can spoof
messages to set the value to whatever they want).<br /><br />Currently you can modify up to 100
items for a user in each call. This call is rate-limited on a per user basis, so you will want to
batch up your modifications and send them at an appropriate time for your game. There is also a
maximum of 1024 bytes of JSON per item at this time.
<h4>Applying Restrictions</h4>
As mentioned previously, you can white-list certain properties so they can be set from the client.
But you can also further restrict what properties can be set by requiring the target item to have a
specific <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">tag_category:tag_value</code> pair or for
any <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">tag_category</code> value. Using these tag
restrictions in combination with the client API, you can allow clients to set properties only on
items where it makes sense (i.e. a hat would not keep track of the number of kills, but a rocket
launcher can). These required tags can exist either on the item or its associated item definition.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="3"></a>Examples</h2>
<br />Say you want to keep track of how many times a user has fired their rocket launcher. There are
a couple of ways to do this, but regardless of which method you choose, you will want to batch up
property modifications, as the calls to modify item properties are rate limited as mentioned above.
<h4>WebAPI</h4>
On your secure game server, you can accumulate that statistic and at the end of the game round or
other appropriate time, you can POST the results to the
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/webapi/IInventoryService#ModifyItems" class="bb_apilink"
    >IInventoryService/ModifyItems</a
>
Web API using your secure publisher key.<br /><br />Example form-data for the POST call:<br />
<div class="bb_code">
    appid: 480 key: "0123456789abcdeffedcba9876543210" input_json:{ "steamid" : "1234", "timestamp"
    : 1513274037, "updates" : [ { "itemid" : "1", "property_name" : "num_times_fired",
    "property_value_int" : 100 } ] }
</div>
<h4>Steamworks API</h4>
If you want to use the Steamworks API to modify item properties (again, inherently insecure), you
will first need to add them to a white-list for your app.<br /><br />Then, as with the above
example, once the game round has ended or other appropriate time, you can start an update, set
properties, and then submit the update to Steam.<br /><br />
<div class="bb_code">
    SteamInventoryUpdateHandle_t updateHandle = SteamInventory()-&gt;StartUpdateProperties();
    SteamInventory()-&gt;SetProperty( updateHandle, nItemID, "num_times_fired", nNumTimesFired );
    SteamInventoryResult_t resultUpdate; SteamInventory()-&gt;SubmitUpdateProperties( updateHandle,
    &amp;resultUpdate );
</div>
<br />Then in your callback handler for
<a
    href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamInventory#SteamInventoryResultReady_t"
    class="bb_apilink"
    >SteamInventoryResultReady_t</a
>, you will get the results of the call to update those item properties.
