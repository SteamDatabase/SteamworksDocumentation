<h1>Steam Economy</h1>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Overview</h2>
The Steam Economy is our name for a set of features that allow in-game items from multiple games to
work together in a single shared system in Steam. In-game items in the Steam Economy can be
purchased via microtransactions, earned from Steam Achievements, delivered in-game, or granted in
response to various kinds of promotions. Users can view their in-game inventories in the Steam
Community, include links to items in chat sessions, and trade items with other users. Steam provides
the user-interface and the heavy lifting for these features, but leaves the game itself in complete
control of the items themselves.<br />
<br />
In-game items in the Steam Economy are called Assets and can represent anything a user can own in a
game. Some examples are equipment, vehicles, character, pets, crafting recipes, etc. The game tells
Steam how to display an asset to a user, but what the asset actually does is left up to the game.
The game is also responsible for keeping track of which user owns which assets and communicating
that information to both users and support agents. It is also the responsibility of the game to
determine which assets are tradable, decide what storage space restrictions users are subject to,
and to provide the support team information about all of the above.<br />
<br />
Each game controls these things by implementing the Steam Asset API. This is a collection of Web
APIs to allow Steam visibility into that back end. Full documentation for the Steam Asset API is
below.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="2"></a>Requirements</h2>
In order to add a game to the Steam Economy a few requirements must be met.<br />
<br />
<ul>
    <li>
        The game must have an asset back-end that is not stored on the game client. Some kind of
        database that lives in a datacenter will be required. That datacenter could be owned by a
        publisher or developer, or it could be provided by a cloud hosting service. Steam offers a
        free <a href="/doc/features/inventory">Inventory Service</a> that can be used as the
        persistent storage of items for your game.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        The game must define a set of
        <a href="/doc/features/inventory/economy/contextid">Context IDs</a> that define the
        containers in which a user can hold assets.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Each game must provide a persistent 64-bit ID for each asset that can be traded to another
        user. At a minimum this asset ID must be unique within the context that contains the
        asset.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        The game must provide inventory icons for all in-game assets via a web server. These icons
        should be available in 96x96 and 200x200 sizes in jpg, png, or gif formats. Steam will
        provide the bandwidth needed to serve these images to users.<br />
    </li>
    <li>The game must implement at least the methods included under Steam Trading below.<br /></li>
    <li>The game should also implement methods from Support Tool Integration.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="3"></a>Only Read Further If...</h2>
You plan to create your own asset tracking service. The rest of this document outlines the required
Web API.<br />
Otherwise, if you plan on using the
<a href="/doc/features/inventory">Steam Inventory Service</a> then you do not need to read any
further.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="4"></a>Steam Trading</h2>
The Steam Trading system uses a web interface to perform trades and view inventories. These pages
are populated with the results of
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">GetContexts</code>,
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">GetContextContents</code>,
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">GetAssetClass</code>, and
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">GetAssetClassInfo</code> in the asset API. Once a
trade is confirmed by both users a three-phase commit is performed across all games involved in the
trade. All of the commit and rollback logic for the three-phase commit is handled in the Economy
server in Steam. It causes ownership changes to occur in games via the
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">TradeSetUnowned</code> and
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">TradeSetOwned</code> methods.<br />

<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="5"></a>Support Tool Integration</h2>
The support tool is the system that Steam support agents use to help out issues that crop up with a
user's assets (and any other account issue in Steam.) Implementing these APIs allows both forms of
the support tool access to the assets in a game.<br />
<br />
Support tool access to games in the Steam Economy is provided through two pages: Economy and
History. The Economy page interacts with the assets in a context with
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">GetContextContents</code> and
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">GetAssetClassInfo</code>. The History page uses
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">GetUserHistory</code>,
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">GetHistoryCommandDetails</code>,
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">HistoryExecuteCommands</code>. Both pages will
display asset details with the results from
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">SupportGetAssetHistory</code>.
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">ContextCommand</code> is used to let support agents
perform context-level and asset-level actions.<br />

<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="6"></a>Web Purchasing</h2>

<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="7"></a>Steam Refunds</h2>
<a href="http://store.steampowered.com/steam_refunds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
    >Steam's refund policy</a
>
allows users to obtain a refund for in-game purchases within 48 hours of purchase as long as none of
the items purchased have been consumed, modified, or transferred. If you wish to participate in this
policy, you will need to implement the following APIs.<br />
<table>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>GET</td>
            <td>
                <a href="/doc/features/inventory/economy/QueryRefundAllowed"

        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="8"></a>Foreign Assets</h2>
If your game imports assets from another game it can call
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">GetExportedAssets</code> to retrieve the assets.<br />
<table>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>GET</td>

        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="9"></a>Interface Versioning</h2>
To allow for future versions of the Asset API, the Economy server will append a version number to
every URL it calls. Currently all of the methods are at version 1 so "/v0001" will be appended to
each URL. So if your asset server URL is
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">https://api.mygame.com/assetapi</code> then
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">GetContexts</code> method will be called as
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight"
    >https://api.mygame.com/assetapi/GetContexts/v0001</code
>
followed by the specified GET<br />
parameters for that method.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="10"></a>API Keys</h2>
If you set an API key in the Economy tab of your game's technical details that key will be passed
into every call made by the economy server.<br />
The key will be in a GET or POST (depending on request type) parameter called "key". Please verify
that the key matches what you set in the Economy tab when you receive a call to ensure that the call
actually came from the Economy server.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="FAQ"></a>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<h4>Q. What is the Steam Economy?</h4>
A. The Steam platform has built-in functionality for secure and reliable trading, a world-wide real
currency marketplace, detailed out-of-game item introspection through the Steam Community, and more.
You can opt in to any or all of this functionality.
<h4>Q.What are the benefits to participating in the Steam economy?</h4>
A. Items in economy-enabled games are more valuable than items that are only used in a single-game
ecosystem, leading to happier customers.<br />
<br />
Players can link to items in Steam profiles and chat, providing additional free exposure for both
the game and the items in it. For games that support trading, items capture value not only for their
current owners, but also for all other active players and potential newcomers. This means, for
example, that all games that use the Steam economy immediately become both more interesting and more
valuable to the players of all other economy-enabled games (like Team Fortress 2 and Dota 2).<br />
<br />
Additionally, you can leverage our existing infrastructure for trading/currency transactions and
support, as well as opt in to any future functionality for free.
<h4>Q.What are the requirements to participate?</h4>
A. Your game must have an asset back-end that is not stored on the game client, aka item server.
Some kind of database that lives in a datacenter will be required.<br />
That datacenter could be owned by a publisher or developer, or it could be provided by a cloud
hosting service. Steam offers a free <a href="/doc/features/inventory">Inventory Service</a> that be
used as the persistent storage of items for your game. That back-end must implement a small number
of WebAPIs so that Steam can communicate with it.
<h4>Q.Can we participate in some parts of the economy, but not all?</h4>
A. The WebAPIs called by Steam provide a single common interface to the Steam Community view of
items, cross-game trading, and the Steam Community Market. You have control at either a broad level
to disable entire features (ie., enable trading but disable all Market transactions) or at a
fine-grained level (ie., all items can be viewed through the Community, some can be traded, but only
specific items can be listed on the Market). You can change these settings per-item at any time.
<h4>Q.Does Valve have a persistent item back-end that we can use as a part of Steamworks?</h4>
A. The <a href="/doc/features/inventory">Steam Inventory Service</a> is available for use.
