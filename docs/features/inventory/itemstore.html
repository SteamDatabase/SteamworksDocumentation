<h1>Steam Inventory Item Store</h1>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="Overview"></a>Overview</h2>
The Steam Item Store is a customizable Steam-hosted web store for selling items defined in the
<a href="/doc/features/inventory">Steam Inventory Service</a>. If you have items defined with prices
in the Steam Inventory Service, then you can simply enable the Item Store to have a place that lists
your purchasable items.<br />

/><br />
<br />
Once enabled for your Steamworks game, this store will provide a set of web pages hosted by Steam
that lists out the priced items you’ve defined in the Steam Inventory Service for your game. Through
these pages, customers can browse, filter, and search through the available items for the game, add
them to a cart within your store, and purchase using the Steam Wallet.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="Setting"></a>Setting Up</h2>
You'll need to start by having a functional
<a href="/doc/features/inventory">Steam Inventory Service</a> implementation. Once you've configured
your Inventory Service and have defined at least one item that have prices defined, then you can
enable the Steam Item Store for your application.<br />
<br />
<ul>
    <li>
        Make sure Inventory Service is enabled for your app. See
        <a href="/doc/features/inventory">Steam Inventory Service</a> for details.<br />
    </li>
    <li>Then go to the 'Edit Store' section for your app and find the Item Store tab.<br /></li>
    <li>
        Check the box to enable your Item Store. There are a few ways you can customize your store
        (see below for details), but they are all optional.
    </li>
</ul>
<br />
Once enabled for your own game, you can easily open your Item Store page from within your game by
launching the Steam Overlay and passing it this page’s URL. Or you can link to this page from your
own website or store page. Your top-selling items will even automatically appear on your base game’s
store page to help customers find your items.<br />

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="Testing"></a>Testing your Item Store</h2>
Your item store will only be visible to members of your Steamworks partner by default. As well, any
purchases you make will go through the microtransaction "sandbox," which will not deduct any funds
from the user's Steam Wallet. Previous to release, you will need to use the beta=1 parameter in any
urls for the item store (e.g.
<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/itemstore/<appid>/?beta=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
    >https://store.steampowered.com/itemstore/&lt;appid&gt;/?beta=1</a
>
).<br />
<br />
Some common issues developers run into:<br />
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>No items show up</strong> - This can happen if no prices have been set for your item
        definitions.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Item Store is not visible</strong> - Your Item Store will only be visible to
        everyone if your app has been released and you've manually set the Item Store live, which
        you can do from the store page settings for your app.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="Customization"></a>Customizing your Item Store</h2>
We’ve made it easy to customize your store with a background image as well as options for a grid or
list view and the ability to define tags that can appear as tabs to be used to filters for the items
shown. As an example, you can see in the screenshot above that the developers of Rust have
customized their Steam Item Store page with a custom background and tabs for easily finding
different types of items.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="1"></a>Naming your store</h2>
You can enter a name for your store and localized versions of that name for display in different
languages. If left blank, we'll just show your app name as the name.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="2"></a>Display format</h2>
You can pick whether to show items in a grid or in a list.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="3"></a>Background</h2>
You can upload a custom background image, which includes your product branding if you wish to change
the overall feel of the store. This image should be 1920px x 1080px and the edges should fade to a
solid background color which you can also specify.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="4"></a>Top-level filters</h2>
You can associate a top-level filter with one or more tags, which are delimited by the ";"
character. Tags are specified in the item definition schema in the
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">store_tags</code> field in your Steam Inventory
Service ItemDefs.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="5"></a>Detail Page</h2>
You can display additional images on the detail page for an item by specifying them in the
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">store_images</code> field in your Steam Inventory
Service ItemDefs. See
<a href="/doc/features/inventory/schema#ItemDefProperties">Steam Inventory Service schema</a>.<br />
