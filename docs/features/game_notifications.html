<h1>Game Notifications</h1>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="Overview"></a>Overview</h2>
Steam Game Notifications is a system for delivering offline notifications to users for games that
provide asynchronous multiplayer gaming, such as Chess.<br />
<br />
The purpose of this API is to notify users that there is action required for a game session to
progress. In the Chess example, game session state is updated after each player's move. Steam will
then send notifications to users based on the state of the game session to alert them when the game
is waiting on their turn.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="1"></a>Responsibilities of the Game</h2>
A typical offline game would manage a game session, updating the status of each user with states
that will, in turn, send a notification to the user so that they will know that they need to launch
the game and perform an action. Upon launching and performing game actions, the game is expected to
update the game session again with the up-to-date states for all users in the session.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="2"></a>What Steam will manage</h2>
Steam will manage notifying users in a game session based on the states provided by the game and the
specific settings that the user has selected for the game. An alert will be displayed in the Steam
client and the web browser for the user when action is required for a game.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="Requirements"></a>Requirements</h2>
The Game Notifications API is provided through Web API methods and requires a valid publisher key.
The Web API method calls must originate from a hosted server that is separated from the game client
– the publisher key must not be shipped with any game client code.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="Authentication"></a>Authentication and 3rd Party Accounts</h2>
In order to call the Game Notifications APIs, you must first establish the identity of the Steam
user logged into your game. You can do this one of two ways: a client game can generate an
authentication session ticket and pass it back to your server, or a web based game can verify the
user by using OpenID. Instructions to do so are available in
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/features/auth#account_linking" class="bb_doclink"
    >Linking third-party accounts to Steam accounts</a
>. It is important that you do not trust user identity in messages sent directly from the game
client to your game server, as these messages can be tampered with.<br />
For games that use 3rd party accounts, use the instructions provided above but cache the user’s
Steam ID in your system.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="API"></a>Game Notifications API</h2>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="TechOverview"></a>Technical Overview</h2>
The Game Notifications API is written and exposed through Web APIs and require 4 parameters passed
in each method:<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>appid (the application id for your game)<br /></li>
    <li>format (the format of the result. We recommend json as the return value)<br /></li>
    <li>input_json ( json encoding of all the parameters required for a method)<br /></li>
    <li>key (your publisher key to be passed with every call)</li>
</ul>
The API will return a HTTP status code of 200 on success, with details in the message body (if
applicable).
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="ConstantValues"></a>Constant Values</h2>
<h4>UserState</h4>
A string value defined as one of below:<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        <strong>waiting</strong> - The user is waiting for other players and not blocking any
        action. No notification will be sent to the user because he is waiting for something to
        happen.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>ready</strong> - The user is ready -- the game session is waiting on a response from
        the user. A notification will be sent to the user until this state has been cleared.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>done</strong> - The game is completed for this user. The user will be notified that
        the game is over, but no action is required.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="LaunchingGameSessions"></a>Launching specific game sessions</h2>
Users will be able to view all their active game sessions on their community profile page in Steam.
Along with game status, there is a button to instruct steam to launch the game with specific launch
parameters to define the game session. When a game is launched this way, a launch parameter of
"_sessionid" will be provided to the game, you can receive this parameter using
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamApps#GetLaunchQueryParam" class="bb_apilink"
    >ISteamApps::GetLaunchQueryParam</a
>.<br />
Like so:<br />
<div class="bb_code">
    const char *pchSessionID = ISteamApps()-&gt;GetLaunchQueryParam("_sessionid");
</div>
A game that supports launching directly into a game in this way should call this interface on game
launch, determine if the session id string is present and valid for the signed in user, and load the
game directly.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="Localization"></a>Localization</h2>
Localization is provided by the game developer through a localization tool that is part of the
application configuration. You are responsible for setting each language translation for every
string entered into the localization tool. Any strings that are not translated to a player’s
language will be rendered in English.<br />
Game notification supports localization for the following properties:<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        <a href="#DataStructures" class="bb_doclink">Session</a><br />
        <ul class="bb_ul">
            <li>Title</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="#DataStructures" class="bb_doclink">UserStatus</a><br />
        <ul class="bb_ul">
            <li>Title<br /></li>
            <li>Message</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<br />
Each <a href="#DataStructures" class="bb_doclink">localized text</a> is comprised of two
components:<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>Token<br /></li>
    <li>List of <a href="#DataStructures" class="bb_doclink">Variables</a></li>
</ul>
<br />
A token is a key that begins with the "#" symbol, and represents a string that is localized in
different languages through the localization tool in your application configuration. A single token
can contain multiple variable instances that can be replaced at runtime based on the context of the
game when the text is to be generated. An example would be:<br />
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight"
    >#InvitationText = "{{user}} has invited you to play a game of Chess."</code
><br />
<br />
In the above example, the English translation for #InvitationText contains a single variable called
user. When you want to render this text message to a user when "SteamUserName" invites him to a
game, you will update LocalizationText object with the following properties:<br />
<div class="bb_code">
    "message": { "token": "#InvitationText", "variables": [ { "key": "user", "value": "Michael" } ]
    }
</div>
<br />
When the player views his status, he will then see this message (in his local language): "Michael
has invited you to play a game of Chess."<br />
Localization tokens can be uploaded in the Async Localization section of the Community tab on the
Steamworks Settings page for your app.<br />
Each language can be uploaded individually in VDF files that look like this:<br />
<div class="bb_code">
    "lang" { "Language" "english" "Tokens" { "TheNameOfTheToken" "The localized text associated with
    the token" "TheNameOfAnotherToken" "The localized text associated with the second token" } }
</div>
<br />
Alternatively, the tokens for all languages can be uploaded in a single file that looks like
this:<br />
<div class="bb_code">
    "lang" { "english" { "Tokens" { "TheNameOfTheToken" "The localized text associated with the
    token" "TheNameOfAnotherToken" "The localized text associated with the second token" } }
    "spanish" { "Tokens" { "TheNameOfTheToken" "El texto localizado asociado con el token"
    "TheNameOfAnotherToken" "El texto localizado asociado con el segundo token" } } }
</div>
