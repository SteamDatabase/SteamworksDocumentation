<h1>Steam Input Stats And Reports</h1>
This documentation describes the sales and activations report for Controller usage in your game.<br />
<br />
To find these new reports, simply navigate to your desired app in the
<a href="https://partner.steampowered.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
    >Steamworks Sales &amp; Activations dashboard</a
>, and click “Controller Stats” in the list of options on the right-hand side.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Stats Page In Detail</h2>
Let’s look at an example report, broken down by each section.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="2"></a>Lifetime Controller Stats</h2>
Breaking down the reports a little, the section at the top tells you how many of your customers have
ever used a controller in any game on Steam as well as the number of your players that have used a
controller in your game. This section can help you understand the potential number of players that
could play your game with a controller if your game is reasonably fun to play with a controller.<br />
<br />

<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="3"></a>Daily Active Controller Users</h2>
Within the selected time range, the report will start by displaying your game’s daily active users
(DAU’s) and the number of those players using a controller. We see across Steam that the average
number of players using a controller is about 8%, but it can vary widely from game to game, and
genre to genre.<br />
<br />

/><br />
<br />
This reporting also includes a graph (shown for any time range longer than a single day) that
displays the usage of major controller types over time. This can be useful to see the impact of
adding new controller support, or to visualize the number of players that are trying to play your
game with certain types of controllers.<br />
<br />
This is a fairly typical graph, where about 20% of the controller sessions are on PlayStation
controllers (the global average is 24%).<br />
<br />

    alt="controllerStats_DAU_graph_default2.png"
    title="controllerStats_DAU_graph_default2.png"
/><br />
<br />
<br />
If your graph looks more like the one below, where less than 10% of total controller sessions are
PlayStation controller usage, then you may have some room to improve your support for PlayStation
controllers.<br />
<br />
<img

    alt="controllerStats_DAU_graph_lowPS.png"
    title="controllerStats_DAU_graph_lowPS.png"
/><br />
<br />
<br />
On the other end of the spectrum, here is an example of a game where 30% of total controller
sessions are PlayStation controllers. This game likely has really good PS controller support. <br />
<br />
<img

    alt="controllerStats_DAU_graph_goodPS.png"
    title="controllerStats_DAU_graph_goodPS.png"
/>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="4"></a>Sessions Per Controller Model</h2>
Next on the report is a table that breaks down the usage of controllers by model, and the percentage
of sessions that are served by the one of the Steam Input services.<br />
<br />
<img
    src="https://cdn.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/controllerStats_SessionsTable2.png"
    alt="controllerStats_SessionsTable2.png"
    title="controllerStats_SessionsTable2.png"
/><br />
<br />
In this example, we can see that most controller sessions in this game (68%) are played with various
Xbox controllers, which is pretty common for a lot of games. Xbox controller support is fairly easy
for developers to add and is built into a lot of game engines. As a result, you see that a small
percentage (17%) of Xbox sessions are using Steam Input – most players stick with the default Xbox
controller support built into the game.<br />
<br />
This also shows that 21% of controller usage is on PlayStation controllers, and almost all (99%) of
those sessions are served by the Steam Input services. That means this game is relying on Steam to
support PlayStation controllers, either through emulation or through Steam Input API integration.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="5"></a>Multi-Controller Sessions</h2>
Lastly, if you have a game with local co-op support, you might find this section interesting. The
first line shows number of total controller game sessions during a designated timeframe. The second
line shows how many of those sessions were played over a local area network and/or coop.<br />
<br />

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="6"></a>What Can You Do With This Information?</h2>
If you have the kind of game that might play well with a controller, there are a few conclusions you
could draw from this new reporting. Here are just a few examples:<br />
<ul>
    <li>
        If the number of customers with controllers is really high, but not many of them are using
        controllers in your game, it might suggest that you haven’t done much (or any) work to
        support controllers in your game.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        If usage of PlayStation controllers in your own game is far below the global average of 24%,
        you might be lacking sufficient support to allow a good player experience with those
        controllers. Integrating with the
        <a
            href="/doc/features/steam_controller/getting_started_for_devs"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noreferrer"
            >Steam Input API</a
        >
        can address almost all possible controller models with a single integration.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Alternatively, if you see low PlayStation controller usage in your game and you don’t have
        the resources to integrate the API solution (or you want to run a test before you do that
        work), you could enable Steam Input Gamepad Emulation to get ‘pretty good’ PlayStation
        controller support in your game without any additional development work. Remember, this
        isn’t full integration and may result in things like the player seeing your existing button
        icon prompts, which wouldn’t necessarily match up with the icons on the controller they are
        using.
    </li>
</ul>
<br />
One final note: If we have just one thing we’d suggest and promote, it would be for more developers
to display the corresponding PlayStation icons in game when there is a prompt for a player to hit a
certain button. You can make your own or you can use the icons already provided with the Steam Input
API integration.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="7"></a>Learn More About Controller Support On Steam</h2>
The Steam Input documentation is a great place to start. There are a couple of introductions to
controller support, and a description of the features and services Steam provides to help offload
much of the work. <br />
