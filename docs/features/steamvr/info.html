<h1>SteamVR</h1>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Overview</h2>
SteamVR is a runtime included with the Steam client that powers virtual reality experiences. SteamVR
is automatically installed when Steam detects a headset connected to a user's PC. It can also be
installed manually.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="2"></a>Features</h2>
SteamVR lets users manage several areas of their VR experience, including:<br />

    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="3"></a>System Report</h2>
System Reports are a useful tool when troubleshooting your hardware, and you may need to generate
one for customer support. You can generate a System Report in SteamVR by going to
Settings-&gt;General, then click Create System Report, and click Save to File.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="4"></a>In-App Purchasing</h2>
SteamVR supports in-app purchasing using the same microtransactions API as other Steam applications.

for more information.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="5"></a>SteamVR Home</h2>

<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="6"></a>SteamVR Collectibles</h2>
SteamVR Collectibles are 3D items granted to players based on ownership and playtime of VR games.
Developers can create custom items that will drop to players to be used as decoration in SteamVR
Home environments. <br />
<br />
Currently SteamVR Collectibles need to be manually imported by Valve. If you would like to

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="7"></a>SteamVR In the Enterprise</h2>
SteamVR is designed to be distributed along with Steam, and receive updates via Steam. Sometimes it
may be desirable to have SteamVR running without Steam, for example if a corporate policy prevents
the Steam client from being installed. Information about running SteamVR in standalone installations
can be found
<a

    >here</a
>.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="8"></a>SteamVR Overlay Apps</h2>
It is possible to create applications that interact directly with the SteamVR overlay, such as
adding additional tabs or enabling other functionality even when other VR applications are running.
You can read more about building overlay apps on the OpenVR GitHub page:

<br />
Overlay apps can be distributed on Steam like other applications by enabling the "Launch SteamVR
Overlay" launch option.<br />
<br />
Two example SteamVR Overlay Apps on Steam:<br />

<strong>OVRDrop: </strong><br />
