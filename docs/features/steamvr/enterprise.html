<h1>SteamVR for Enterprise / Government Use</h1>
This page provides guidance on how to obtain the necessary licenses and files to use SteamVR
software and/or Valve Index hardware in an enterprise or government use environment.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Licensing</h2>
The basic Steam Subscriber Agreement only covers the usage of Steam software for personal,
noncommercial use. If you plan to use SteamVR for commercial purposes you should first identify
whether you want to make your installation available to members of the public, such as in a VR
arcade, a school or other educational or entertainment installation, or whether you want to use
SteamVR internally, such as for your company's design or visualization teams. <br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        For a public installation we encourage you to familiarize yourself with the Steam PC Cafe
        Program

    <a name="2"></a>Installation/use of SteamVR in an environment without internet access
</h2>
Many enterprise or government users are unable to use the Steam client to access the SteamVR
Runtime, particularly due to restricted internet access behind corporate firewalls or on PCs without
any internet connection. <br />
<br />
In order to address this issue you can download one initial copy of the SteamVR Runtime onto a PC
with full internet access and then copy it manually onto the target PC(s). In order to do so, follow
these steps: <br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        Install and open the
        <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/about/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
            >Steam Client</a
        >
        on a PC with full internet access.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        In the Steam Client, open the Library section and find the part of it labeled "Tools".<br />
    </li>
    <li>Find the entry "SteamVR" and install it.<br /></li>
    <li>
        Right-click on the entry "SteamVR" and in the resulting popup menu click on the entry
        "Properties".<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        A new window with multiple tabs will open. Select the tab "Installed Files" and click on the
        button labeled "Browse...".<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        The directory containing the SteamVR Runtime will open. Copy this entire directory onto a
        portable medium of your choice (e.g. a USB thumb drive) and copy it again onto the target PC
        that does not have access to the internet. <br />
    </li>
    <li>In order to run SteamVR you should start the file "vrstartup.exe"<br /></li>
    <li>
        SteamVR should now be running on the new PC and support any application that is built using
        the OpenVR SDK, the SteamVR Unity Plugin or the VR tools within Unreal Engine.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="3"></a>Troubleshooting</h2>
If you install SteamVR on a system that does not include Steam as per the above workflow, depending
on what software was previously installed on that system you may be missing some software
dependencies. If this is the case on your system you may see an error message reporting one or
several of the following of the following files missing on your system:<br />
<br />
d3dx10_43.dll<br />
MSVCP140.dll<br />
VCRUNTIME140.dll<br />
MSVCP140.dll<br />
<br />
This issue can generally be addressed by installing the Microsoft DirectX Runtime and the Microsoft
Visual C++ Redistributable. You should always install the most recent version of these, which you
can find under the following download links:<br />
<br />
DirectX Runtime:<br />
