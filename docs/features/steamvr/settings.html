<h1>Application Settings for Virtual Reality</h1>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Overview</h2>
You can manage the Virtual Reality settings for your application on Steamworks in two places: <br />
<ul>
    <li>
        Steamworks Settings - Set the SteamVR input binding mode for your application, as well as
        launch options.<br />
    </li>
    <li>Store Page - Describe your VR requirements and supported configurations</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="2"></a>Steamworks Settings</h2>
Steamworks settings enable you to define the SteamVR input binding mode for your application, and
define your launch options. <br />
<br />
To get started, click the "Edit Steamworks Settings" link on the App Landing Page.<br />

<br />
On this page, you can define which SteamVR input binding mode your application uses.<br />
<br />
When using OpenXR, your input binding setup will dramatically affect how many users can buy and play
your game. If your game submits a suggested input binding for Meta Quest 2 controllers, SteamVR will
automatically rebind most controller types so they will work. The following controller profiles
should have customized bindings, due to the difficulty in automatically rebinding them:<br />
<ul>
    <li>HTC Vive wands<br /></li>
    <li>Valve Index controllers<br /></li>
    <li>Windows Mixed Reality controllers</li>
</ul>
<br />
If you build with OpenVR, your application will automatically support any current and future
OpenVR-supported head-mounted displays (HMDs), such as the HTC Vive, Oculus Rift, or Windows Mixed
Reality family of devices. You can also distribute your native Oculus SDK build for Rift users if
you prefer.<br />

<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="3"></a>Launch Options</h2>
<br />
You'll need to define at least one VR launch option for your application before VR support is
enabled. Launch Options tell Steam how to handle your application when users launch it in their
library. You can also use launch options to let users choose between different modes of your
application (non-VR, VR, Vulkan, etc).<br />
<br />
Launch options can be tied to specific branches, executables, or command-line arguments for your
application. For example, you might have a command-line argument "mygame.exe --novr" which launches
in desktop mode. Launch options allow you to let users select these options in a more intuitive
way.<br />
<br />
To set launch options, select "Edit Steamworks Settings" from the App Landing Page. Under
"Installation", select "General."<br />
<br />

/><br />
<br />
Every application needs to define at least one launch option. If you built your application with the
OpenVR SDK, select "Launch SteamVR App." You can add additional launch options depending on the
needs of your application by clicking "Add New Launch Option." Steam looks for the presence of a VR
launch option to add some of the VR information to your store page.<br />

You can also manage what Virtual Reality settings are visible on your Steam store page. To get
started, select "Edit Store Page" on the App Landing Page, then select the "Basic Info" tab and
scroll down to "Supported Platforms". <br />

<br />
In the fields under "VR Devices and Support" you should describe both the SDKs and the specific
devices that your game supports. Start with the SDK such as OpenXR or SteamVR and then describe any
individual headsets, controllers, and/or room size requirements.
