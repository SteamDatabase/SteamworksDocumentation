<h1>Valve Anti-Cheat (VAC) and Game Bans</h1>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="Overview"></a>Overview</h2>
Steam provides several tools to help manage cheating in online video games. Whether you choose to
integrate our anti-cheat APIs or use your own solution, make sure you give your customers proper
warning that such a system exists and that you have UI ingame that clearly explains the ban.<br /><br />For
an introduction to anti-cheat and general best practices, we recommend that you watch the

/><br />Valve Anti-Cheat (VAC) is an automated system designed to detect cheats installed on users'
computers. If a user connects to a VAC-Secured server from a computer with identifiable cheats
installed, the VAC system will ban the user from playing that game on VAC-Secured servers in the
future.<br /><br /><strong
    >NOTE: VAC only attempts to detect cheats reported by the developer. Valve does not actively
    seek out cheats either automatically or through manual digging.</strong

/><br />Game Bans allow you to utilize Valve’s banning infrastructure rather than implement your own
ban tracking system. When you ban a player using the

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="BestPractices"></a>Best Practices</h2>
Below is a list of best practices when using the provided Steamworks anti-cheat services. For
broader anti-cheat best practices, please refer to the video above.<br />
<ol class="bb_ol">
    <li>
        Running servers for your game is strongly suggested. Having a server handle game state and
        only transmitting game state to the user when necessary can help prevent cheating. For
        example only transmitting player position when necessary. The server can also be
        authoritative on player position and other game states to prevent speed hacking or god
        mode.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        If your game uses peer-to-peer, each user should validate the others to prevent the host
        from having full control of the game state which would allow them to cheat or bypass
        restrictions.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        When the
        <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/features/auth" class="bb_doclink"
            >Authentication API</a
        >
        call
        <a
            href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamGameServer#BeginAuthSession"
            class="bb_apilink"
            >ISteamGameServer::BeginAuthSession</a
        >
        returns
        <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight"
            >k_EAuthSessionResponseVACCheckTimedOut</code
        >, the player should be removed from the server as VAC is unable to challenge the user or
        the user is in a state that would indicate they may be running a cheat.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        When a user is banned or kicked they should receive clear messaging in-game explaining why
        they are unable to play.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Game bans are only designed to manage cheating. They should only be applied to players who
        gained an unfair competitive advantage when playing multiplayer versions of content and
        services.
    </li>

    <a name="Permissions"></a>Required Permissions For Editing Anti-Cheat Policies
</h2>
<strong>Who can set or edit Anti-Cheat policies for my product?</strong><br />Only certain publisher
accounts have the necessary permissions to enable or adjust anti-cheat policies for your products on
Steam. If you don't have the necessary permissions as detailed below, the best bet is to contact one
of your Steamworks Administrators, which is a user within your organization that has the ability to
grant permissions. A list of your Steamworks Administrators can be found on the right column of your
Steamworks home page (unless you are an Administrator yourself).<br /><br />The following
permissions are required for a specific account in order to set or adjust anti-cheat policies for a
product:<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        Your account must have the specific permission: "Manage Signing" for the product in
        question. See

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="Gifting"></a>Gift Restrictions</h2>
<strong>Enabling Anti-Cheat API access affects gift copies of your game!</strong><br />Both VAC and
Game Ban enabled games can either be bought for your own account, or gifted immediately. If you
directly gift a game to someone who gets permanently banned, you won’t be able to gift that game
again.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="FAQ"></a>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    >Q: Can I use bans in other games to block users from playing in my game?</strong
><br />A: No. VAC and Game bans should only prevent the user from playing on VAC secured servers in
the game they received a ban in. A permanent ban should only be issued for your game if the user was
caught cheating in your game.
