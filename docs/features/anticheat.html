<h1>Anti-cheat and Game Bans</h1>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="Overview"></a>Overview</h2>
Steam provides several tools to help manage cheating in online video games. Whether you choose to
integrate our anti-cheat APIs or use your own solution, make sure you give your customers proper
warning that such a system exists and that you have UI ingame that clearly explains the ban.<br />
<br />
For an introduction to anti-cheat and general best practices, we recommend that you watch the

Game Bans allow you to utilize Valveâ€™s banning infrastructure rather than implement your own ban
tracking system. When you ban a player using the
<a href="/doc/webapi/ICheatReportingService#RequestPlayerGameBan"
    >ICheatReportingService/RequestPlayerGameBan</a
>
Web API, the ban will be publicly visible on that person's Steam profile.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="BestPractices"></a>Best Practices</h2>
Below is a list of best practices when using the provided Steamworks anti-cheat services. For
broader anti-cheat best practices, please refer to the video above.<br />
<ol>
    <li>
        Running servers for your game is strongly suggested. Having a server handle game state and
        only transmitting game state to the user when necessary can help prevent cheating. For
        example only transmitting player position when necessary. The server can also be
        authoritative on player position and other game states to prevent speed hacking or god
        mode.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        If your game uses peer-to-peer, each user should validate the others to prevent the host
        from having full control of the game state which would allow them to cheat or bypass
        restrictions.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        When a user is banned or kicked they should receive clear messaging in-game explaining why
        they are unable to play.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Game bans are only designed to manage cheating. They should only be applied to players who
        gained an unfair competitive advantage when playing multiplayer versions of content and
        services.
    </li>
</ol>

    <a name="Permissions"></a>Required Permissions For Editing Anti-Cheat Policies
</h2>
<strong>Who can set or edit Anti-Cheat policies for my product?</strong><br />
Only certain publisher accounts have the necessary permissions to enable or adjust anti-cheat
policies for your products on Steam. If you don't have the necessary permissions as detailed below,
the best bet is to contact one of your Steamworks Administrators, which is a user within your
organization that has the ability to grant permissions. A list of your Steamworks Administrators can
be found on the right column of your Steamworks home page (unless you are an Administrator
yourself).<br />
<br />
The following permissions are required for a specific account in order to set or adjust anti-cheat
policies for a product:<br />
<ul>
    <li>
        Your account must have the specific permission: "Manage Signing" for the product in
        question. See
        <a href="/doc/gettingstarted/managing_users">Managing Your Steamworks Account</a> for more
        details.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="Gifting"></a>Gift Restrictions</h2>
<strong>Enabling Anti-Cheat API access affects gift copies of your game!</strong><br />
By default, games can either be bought for a user's own account, or sent as a gift from that user.
But If a user sends a gift to someone who gets permanently banned, that user will not be able to
gift the game again.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="FAQ"></a>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<br />
<strong>Q: Can I use bans in other games to block users from playing in my game?</strong><br />
A: No. Game bans should only prevent the user from playing on secure servers in the game they
received a ban in. A permanent ban should only be issued for your game if the user was caught
cheating in your game.
