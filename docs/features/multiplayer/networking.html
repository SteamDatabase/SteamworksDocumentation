<h1>Steam Networking</h1>
We have a few different networking APIs that can be used to send messages between players.<br />
<br />
Our newest APIs relay packets through the Valve network by default, which ensures that players and
gameservers are protected. It is higher performance and uses a higher-quality reliability layer. It
also supports ordinary UDP connectivity. An open-source version is available on
<a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/GameNetworkingSockets" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"

<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="/doc/api/ISteamNetworkingMessages">ISteamNetworkingMessages</a> is a high level
        interface for sending messages to arbitrary peers. It is like UDP, in the sense that
        connection handles are not used. You specify the message recipient each time you send a
        message, similar to the sendto() socket function. You do not need to select one peer to be
        the "client" and initiate the connection, and the server does not need to "listen" for
        client connections or "accept" them. Either peer can send messages immediately. Because it
        is very similar to UDP, it may be the easiest API to port existing UDP code. However, unlike
        raw UDP, the API supports messages larger than a single packet, and reliable message
        delivery. Traffic is relayed through the Valve backbone, or a direct connection may be
        established when appropriate.<br />

    <li>
        <a href="/doc/api/ISteamNetworkingSockets">ISteamNetworkingSockets</a> is a lower-level
        connection-handle-oriented interface for sending and receiving messages.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="/doc/api/ISteamNetworkingUtils">ISteamNetworkingUtils</a> has miscellaneous
        utilities, including tools for estimating ping times between arbitrary internet hosts.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="/doc/api/steamnetworkingtypes">steamnetworkingtypes</a> is a header that has many
        common types and utilities.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="/doc/features/multiplayer/steamdatagramrelay">Steam Datagram Relay</a> is a service
        for relaying your game traffic over the Valve backbone. This prevents IP addresses from
        being revealed and in many cases improves ping times and connection quality. All P2P
        connections are automatically relayed over the Valve backbone when appropriate. This
        document describes what you need to do if you want to use SDR for dedicated server games, to
        optimize ping times and protect servers from DoS attack.
    </li>
</ul>
<br />
<a href="/doc/api/ISteamNetworking">ISteamNetworking</a> is an older, deprecated API. If you are
using it, consider migrating to a newer API soon, as we may remove this API from the SDK in a future
release.<br />
<br />
This API works best when used with
<a href="/doc/features/multiplayer/matchmaking">Steam Matchmaking &amp;amp;amp; Lobbies</a>,
depending on the types of packets you could route everything through one player that is acting as
the host (typically the lobby owner) or game server, or send everything out directly to each
player.<br />
<br />
