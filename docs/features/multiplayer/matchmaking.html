<h1>Steam Matchmaking &amp; Lobbies</h1>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Overview</h2>
Steam's peer-to-peer matchmaking is built around the concept of a lobby. A lobby is a entity that
lives on the Steam back-end servers that is a lot like a chat room. Users can create a new lobby;
associate data with a lobby; search for lobbies based on that data; join lobbies; and share
information with other users in the lobby. A single lobby can have up to 250 users in it, although
typically most games have at most 2-16 players. Skill-based matchmaking is built on top of this
system.<br />
<br />
The Steam peer-to-peer matchmaking API is a set of functions that enable users to find other users
to play a game with. The matchmaking functions all live in
<a href="/doc/api/ISteamMatchmaking">ISteamMatchmaking</a>, which contains more details on the
parameters for each function. Lobbies are uniquely identified by Steam ID, like users or game
servers. The Steamworks Example has a full working implementation of lobbies.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="2"></a>Matchmaking process flow</h2>
The usual model for getting groups together to play is as follows:<br />
<ol>
    <li>
        User selects in the game that they want to play multiplayer, and what kind of multiplayer
        they want (rules, scenario, etc.)<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        The game searches for lobbies that have a similar same set of rules, using the lobby search
        API.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        If a lobby is found, then the game joins that lobby; if no lobby is found, then it creates a
        new lobby<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Users stay in a lobby until there are enough players ready to launch the game. Data is
        communicated between the lobby members about which character they want to play, or other
        per-user settings. If there are some rules that need to be enforced in the lobby (for
        example, only one user can play as a certain character), there is one and only one lobby
        owner who you can use to arbitrate that.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        There may or may not be a user interface associated with the lobby; if there is, the lobby
        data communications functions can be used to send chat messages between lobby members. Voice
        data can also be sent, but needs to be sent using the
        <a href="/doc/features/multiplayer/networking">Steam Networking</a> API.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Once the game is ready to launch, the users all join the game server, or connect to the user
        nominated to host the game, and then leave the lobby. Once all users have left a lobby, it
        is automatically destroyed.
    </li>
</ol>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="3"></a>Searching for lobbies</h2>
To have your game search for a lobby, you need to call:
<a href="/doc/api/ISteamMatchmaking#RequestLobbyList">ISteamMatchmaking::RequestLobbyList</a><br />
This function is asynchronous, returning a SteamAPICall_t handle which you can use to track the
state of the request. Depending on the users connection to the Steam back-end, this call can take
from 300ms to 5 seconds to complete, and has a timeout of 20 seconds.<br />
The number of results returned is in the
<a href="/doc/api/ISteamMatchmaking#LobbyMatchList_t">LobbyMatchList_t</a> call result, which you
can then use
<a href="/doc/api/ISteamMatchmaking#GetLobbyByIndex">ISteamMatchmaking::GetLobbyByIndex</a> to
iterate over them all and get their IDs.<br />
Up to 50 results may be returned, but usually it's no more than a couple. The results are returned
ordered by geographical distance and based on any near filters set. By default, we will not return
lobbies that are already full, and the distance filter is set to
<a href="/doc/api/ISteamMatchmaking#k_ELobbyDistanceFilterDefault">k_ELobbyDistanceFilterDefault</a>
(nearby). To add filters, before you call
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">RequestLobbyList</code> you need to call one or
more of the filtering functions:<br />
<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="/doc/api/ISteamMatchmaking#AddRequestLobbyListStringFilter"
            >ISteamMatchmaking::AddRequestLobbyListStringFilter</a
        >
        - Adds a string comparison filter.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="/doc/api/ISteamMatchmaking#AddRequestLobbyListNumericalFilter"
            >ISteamMatchmaking::AddRequestLobbyListNumericalFilter</a
        >
        - Adds a numerical comparison filter.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="/doc/api/ISteamMatchmaking#AddRequestLobbyListNearValueFilter"
            >ISteamMatchmaking::AddRequestLobbyListNearValueFilter</a
        >
        - Sorts the results closest to the specified value.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="/doc/api/ISteamMatchmaking#AddRequestLobbyListFilterSlotsAvailable"
            >ISteamMatchmaking::AddRequestLobbyListFilterSlotsAvailable</a
        >
        - Filters to only return lobbies with the specified number of open slots available.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="/doc/api/ISteamMatchmaking#AddRequestLobbyListDistanceFilter"
            >ISteamMatchmaking::AddRequestLobbyListDistanceFilter</a
        >
        - Sets the physical distance for which we should search for lobbies, this is based on the
        users IP address and an IP location map on the Steam backed.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="/doc/api/ISteamMatchmaking#AddRequestLobbyListResultCountFilter"
            >ISteamMatchmaking::AddRequestLobbyListResultCountFilter</a
        >
        - Sets the maximum number of lobbies to return. The lower the count the faster it is to
        download the lobby results &amp; details to the client.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="4"></a>Creating a lobby</h2>
If you can't find an existing lobby for a user to join, this is when you'd typically create a lobby.
Just call <a href="/doc/api/ISteamMatchmaking#CreateLobby">ISteamMatchmaking::CreateLobby</a> and
wait for it to complete. The call result indicates whether or not it succeeded, and if it did, it
will return the steamID of the lobby in a
<a href="/doc/api/ISteamMatchmaking#LobbyCreated_t">LobbyCreated_t</a> struct, which can be used to
set metadata on the lobby. The first thing you'll want to do after you create a lobby is set a data
on the lobby, that other game clients can use to search for it (see below).
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="5"></a>Joining a lobby</h2>
If you've found a good lobby, either from a search or from a friend, you can use
<a href="/doc/api/ISteamMatchmaking#JoinLobby">ISteamMatchmaking::JoinLobby</a> and wait for the
<a href="/doc/api/ISteamMatchmaking#LobbyEnter_t">LobbyEnter_t</a> call result. Once in the lobby,
you'll want to use the lobby data API to get details about the lobby to work out what to display (if
there is any display).<br />
<br />
When a user joins or leaves a lobby, a
<a href="/doc/api/ISteamMatchmaking#LobbyChatUpdate_t">LobbyChatUpdate_t</a> callback is posted to
all members of that lobby, including the owner.<br />
<br />
To iterate which users are currently in a lobby, use:<br />
<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="/doc/api/ISteamMatchmaking#GetNumLobbyMembers"
            >ISteamMatchmaking::GetNumLobbyMembers</a
        ><br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="/doc/api/ISteamMatchmaking#GetLobbyMemberByIndex"
            >ISteamMatchmaking::GetLobbyMemberByIndex</a
        >
    </li>
</ul>
<br />
To get more information about another user in the lobby, you'll need to use the friends API, see
<a href="#friends">Friends, invites, and lobbies</a> for more information.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="6"></a>Lobby Metadata</h2>
Lobby Metadata allows you to set the arbitrary state of the lobby, including the lobbies name,
current map, game mode, current state of the game, or anything else you can think of. <br />
<br />
A user will automatically have the latest lobby data for any lobby they are a member of. For lobbies
returned via search results, the user will have lobby data for at the point in time as to when they
did the search. If it's a friends' lobby, there will be no lobby data available to look at until
<a href="/doc/api/ISteamMatchmaking#RequestLobbyData">ISteamMatchmaking::RequestLobbyData</a> is
called and has successfully completed.<br />
<br />
If lobby data is changed on a lobby, all lobby members will receive a
<a href="/doc/api/ISteamMatchmaking#LobbyDataUpdate_t">LobbyDataUpdate_t</a> callback (this callback
is the same way you know a
<a href="/doc/api/ISteamMatchmaking#RequestLobbyData">ISteamMatchmaking::RequestLobbyData</a> call
has completed).<br />
<br />
These are the set of functions you can use to get and set lobby data. Only the lobby owner can set
or delete the lobby data.<br />
<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="/doc/api/ISteamMatchmaking#SetLobbyData">ISteamMatchmaking::SetLobbyData</a><br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="/doc/api/ISteamMatchmaking#GetLobbyData">ISteamMatchmaking::GetLobbyData</a><br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="/doc/api/ISteamMatchmaking#DeleteLobbyData">ISteamMatchmaking::DeleteLobbyData</a>
    </li>
</ul>
<br />
Functions which allow you to iterate over the metadata, (this is typically only used for debugging
purposes):<br />
<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="/doc/api/ISteamMatchmaking#GetLobbyDataCount"
            >ISteamMatchmaking::GetLobbyDataCount</a
        ><br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="/doc/api/ISteamMatchmaking#GetLobbyDataByIndex"
            >ISteamMatchmaking::GetLobbyDataByIndex</a
        >
    </li>
</ul>
<br />
Lobbies also allow members to set their own metadata that other members can receive updates for with
the following functions.<br />
<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="/doc/api/ISteamMatchmaking#GetLobbyMemberData"
            >ISteamMatchmaking::GetLobbyMemberData</a
        ><br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="/doc/api/ISteamMatchmaking#SetLobbyMemberData"
            >ISteamMatchmaking::SetLobbyMemberData</a
        >
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="7"></a>Communication within a lobby</h2>
To send information around within a lobby (chat messages, game start signals, etc.) you need to call
<a href="/doc/api/ISteamMatchmaking#SendLobbyChatMsg">ISteamMatchmaking::SendLobbyChatMsg</a>, this
sends a simple binary message to all users in the lobby. Lobby members need to listen for the
callback <a href="/doc/api/ISteamMatchmaking#LobbyChatMsg_t">ISteamMatchmaking::LobbyChatMsg_t</a>.
After receiving the callback you then can use
<a href="/doc/api/ISteamMatchmaking#GetLobbyChatEntry">ISteamMatchmaking::GetLobbyChatEntry</a> to
retrieve the contents of the message.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="friends"></a>Friends, invites, and lobbies</h2>
You can find out all the lobbies a user's friends are in with the friends API:<br />
<div class="bb_code">
    int cFriends = SteamFriends()-&gt;GetFriendCount( k_EFriendFlagImmediate ); for ( int i = 0; i
    &lt; cFriends; i++ ) { FriendGameInfo_t friendGameInfo; CSteamID steamIDFriend =
    SteamFriends()-&gt;GetFriendByIndex( i, k_EFriendFlagImmediate ); if (
    SteamFriends()-&gt;GetFriendGamePlayed( steamIDFriend, &amp;friendGameInfo ) &amp;&amp;
    friendGameInfo.m_steamIDLobby.IsValid() ) { // friendGameInfo.m_steamIDLobby is a valid lobby,
    you can join it or use RequestLobbyData() get its metadata } }
</div>
<br />
You can invite a friend to a lobby with
<a href="/doc/api/ISteamMatchmaking#InviteUserToLobby">ISteamMatchmaking::InviteUserToLobby</a
><br />
That user will receive a chat dialog with a link to join the game. If the user clicks the link, and
they are not currently running the game, it will launch the game with the command-line:<br />
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">+connect_lobby &lt;64-bit lobby id&gt;</code>. Be
sure your app implements
<a href="/doc/api/ISteamApps#GetLaunchCommandLine">ISteamApps::GetLaunchCommandLine</a> so you can
disable the popup warning when launched via a command line.<br />
<br />
If the user is already in a game, a
<a href="/doc/api/ISteamFriends#GameLobbyJoinRequested_t"
    >ISteamFriends::GameLobbyJoinRequested_t</a
>
callback will be posted, which contains the Steam ID of the lobby the user wishes to join. It's up
to your game to decide to obey it or not.<br />
<br />
If you want the user to select from a list of friends to invite to a lobby, you can call
<a href="/doc/api/ISteamFriends#ActivateGameOverlayInviteDialog"
    >ISteamFriends::ActivateGameOverlayInviteDialog</a
>.<br />
This will activate the Steam in-game overlay to a dialog designed for inviting friends to the
current lobby.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="authentication"></a>Authentication</h2>
Any user in a Steam lobby is already fully authenticated with the Steam back-end. There is no need
for the game to do any more authentication steps with lobby users, unless it's looking to see if
they're VAC banned (see Valve Anti-Cheat Technology). If a user tries to log in from a second
location with the same account, their prior login will automatically be removed from any existing
lobbies.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="8"></a>Cleaning up</h2>
Once the game has started, each user can just leave the lobby with:<br />
<a href="/doc/api/ISteamMatchmaking#LeaveLobby">ISteamMatchmaking::LeaveLobby</a><br />
Once all the users have left, the lobby is automatically destroyed on the back-end.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="9"></a>Lobby Tips</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        In general, only create lobbies when needed. For example, when the user invites a friend to
        play, or triggers a manual action that requires a lobby<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Do not update the metadata on lobbies at a high frequency. Only add in metadata and values
        that are used for search (for example, game type or game state). You will not need to put in
        player counts, as a lobby search will already look for lobbies with available slots<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Do not join lobbies just to find out their metadata. Lobby metadata can be downloaded
        separately for all lobbies, which your game can then use to either show a list of lobbies
        for a user to pick from, or the game can automatically decide which search result to join
    </li>
</ul>
