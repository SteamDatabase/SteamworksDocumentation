<h1>Steam Playtest</h1>
Steam Playtest gives developers a free, low-risk way to get playtesting data for their game without
stressing out about Steam keys, user reviews, or wishlists. By using a separate “child” appID that
is associated with, but separate from your main game, you can do the playtesting you need without
interfering with your main game.<br />
<br />
Here's an overview:<br />

><br />
<br />
Steam Playtest also lets you easily gate access to your playtest. You can let in as many or as few
players as you need, and deactivate the playtest app when you wish.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>How does it work?</h2>
A Steam Playtest appID has access to the same Steamworks technical features as your main game - but
with reduced store and community setup. Instead of having its own separate store page, your Steam
Playtest signup will live right on your main game, so that customers can sign up and access the
playtest but still Wishlist or Follow the main game. <br />
<br />
Here’s what a Steam Playtest signup looks like to customers:<br />

    title="Join the Playtest"
/><br />
<br />
Potential testers will be able to request access to your Steam Playtest if they're interested. When
you're ready for testers to try it out, you can add as many as you'd like from the group of
interested players. You can deactivate your Playtest app when you're ready - or leave it available
if you want to keep experimenting with upcoming features.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="2"></a>How do I set it up?</h2>
<ol>
    <li>
        Create a new Playtest app from the <i>Associated Packages &amp; DLC </i>page for your
        game.<br />
        <br />
        <img
            src="https://cdn.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/playtest_create_screenshot0.png"
            alt="Create a new Playtest"
            title="Create a new Playtest"
        /><br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Configure your application in Steamworks. <br />
        <br />
        At minimum, you must provide required library capsule assets and community assets (see
        <a href="/doc/store/assets/libraryassets">Library Assets</a>). You can also change the
        customer-visible name for your Playtest app (<a href="/doc/store/localization"
            >including localized names</a
        >) - you won't be able to change this after it's released.<br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        When you're ready, complete the release process for your Playtest app. This will include a
        simplified store page and build review. <strong>Note</strong>: Your playtest will
        <i>not </i>have its own unique store page, it will only show up as a section on the base
        game's page. The store review checklist for a Playtest only consists of capsule images and
        icons.<br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        You can start allowing Steam Playtest signups by making it visible on the store page of your
        main game. Go to the Special Settings tab of the Edit Store Page admin tools for your main
        game to enable signups. Once you publish the change to this page, customers will see the
        sign up option in the Steam store.<br />
        <br />
        <img
            src="https://cdn.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/playtest_special_settings_screenshot0.png"
            alt="playtest_special_settings_screenshot0.png"
            title="playtest_special_settings_screenshot0.png"
        /><br />
        <br />
        You will be able to show or hide Playtest signups whenever you like.<br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Now that customers are signing up for your Steam Playtest, you can prepare your content for
        them. Upload depots and set up builds on the Playtest just like any other game or demo. You
        can integrate Steamworks technical features, set Steam Input templates, configure cloud
        saves, and so on. If you’ve never done any of that before, start with our
        <a href="/doc/sdk/uploading">Uploading to Steam documentation</a> for help.<br />
        <br />
        As an alternative, you can request Steam keys for your Steam Playtest app and distribute
        those to playtesters directly. Please see the section below for more information.<br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        When your Playtest is ready and your build is live, you can start accepting players. In the
        Steamworks Settings for your Playtest App, follow the Manage Your Playtest link (or find
        Playtest Settings under the Application tab). You can add groups of players when you're
        ready. Players are selected randomly from the pool of signups.<br />
        <br />
        You can also choose specific countries in the event that you have limited server
        availability and want to make sure latency is not an issue during your playtest.<br />
        <br />
        <img
            src="https://cdn.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/granting.png"
            alt="granting.png"
            title="granting.png"
        /><br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Once you’re done collecting playtesting data, you can deactivate the playtest by setting to
        "Not Playable" from the Steam Playtest partner settings page. This option will not be shown
        while signups are being accepted on the Steam store. After deactivation, Steam will not
        launch the playtest app.<br />
        <br />
        Be thoughtful about this action! You might frustrate or disappoint your community if you
        take away the experience without communicating it beforehand, so it probably makes sense to
        set expectations in advance. You can use
        <a href="/doc/marketing/event_tools" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
            >Steam Events and Announcements</a
        >
        to communicate your playtest details.<br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        If you want to restart your Playtest after it's ended, perhaps you made some changes or
        increased server capacity, you can set your Playtest to Visible again. Players that already
        had been granted access will still have access and do not need to signup or be granted
        access again.
    </li>
</ol>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="3"></a>Signup Type</h2>
The default behavior is limited signup - potential playtesters request access, and you grant access
in batches as you have capacity to accept them. <br />
<br />
If your game is ready for more people, you can also set your playtest to Open signup: as players
request access from the base game store page, they will be automatically added.<br />
<br />
Changing from a limited-signup playtest (the default) will kick off a process that accepts any
pending playtesters. This will generally start within a few minutes.<br />
<br />
The signup type option is also controlled from the Steam Playtest page on the partner site. You can
change the signup type whenever you need.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="4"></a>Using Steam Keys for your Steam Playtest</h2>
<br />
You can distribute Steam keys for your Playtest. Your Playtest does not require a public signup, and
you can generate and distribute keys for a Playtest even if your store page is not live yet. This
should give you fine-grained control to implement the testing rollout plan you have designed for
your game.<br />
<br />
Most developers will find using Playtest keys easier and safer to work with than Release State
Override keys for their base game. The Playtest can support larger key rollouts much easier--you
will typically be limited to 2,500 Release State Override keys for your base game but you can
generally request much larger quantities of Playtest keys. Additionally, you can control access to
the Playtest using the Playable setting. Note that a key, once granted, is not revoked if the
Playtest is later marked Not Playable.<br />
<br />
To use Steam Keys for your Steam Playtest, follow these steps:<br />
<br />
<ul>
    <li>
        Request Steam keys for your Steam Playtest app. You can only request Standard Release Steam
        keys for your playtest, which means that once the key is activated the playtest will only be
        playable when it is "released", i.e. Playtest Status: Playable. It's not possible to request
        Release State Override (beta) Steam keys for a Steam Playtest.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Set your Steam Playtest to "playable". It's not a requirement that your Steam store page is
        publicly visible on Steam to run your playtest using Steam keys.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        When you want to stop playtesting, you can set your Steam Playtest app to "not playable".
        Note that a key, once granted, is not automatically revoked if the Playtest is later marked
        Not Playable.
    </li>
</ul>
<br />
While Steam keys are a free service Steam provides for developers to run their playtests, they are
not unlimited. When you are at the point when you want to request more than 50,000 keys for your
Steam Playtest, your playtest is effectively an open beta and you should feel comfortable opening
signups on your Steam store page. Valve looks at each request on a case by case basis and reserves
the right to reject Steam Key requests.<br />

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="5"></a>Confidential Playtests for Unannounced Games</h2>
<br />
Be cautious whenever running a confidential playtest for an unannounced game. Even when configured
properly, a confidential playtest will only ever be as confidential as your "least confidential"
playtester and any leaked details from your playtest, including screenshots or videos, could
potentially spread around the internet in moments. For these reasons, it's best to announce your
game first, before running any external playtests outside of your organization. <br />
<br />
However, if you really want to run a confidential playtest for an unannounced game (sometimes called
a "friends &amp; family" alpha), the most secure way to attempt this is via Release Override Steam
keys on the <i>unreleased</i> base app (i.e. not a Playtest App). Keep in mind that maintaining
confidentiality requires a few extra steps, risks, and considerations:<br />
<br />
<ol>
    <li>
        Players accepting a Steam key for a confidential playtest aren’t under nondisclosure
        agreements (NDAs) with you, so you'll need your own solution if you want to register them
        and ensure they've agreed to an NDA prior to receiving a key. Once they've successfully
        registered, you'll also need your own solution for securely distributing a Release State
        Override key to them. <br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Your playtesters may have installed 3rd party apps or web extensions that automatically
        surface information on anything their Steam client is running, even unreleased or
        unannounced games. Some of these 3rd party programs may even prompt the playtester for more
        information about your unannounced game, for example: "We don't recognize this game, can you
        tell us more about it?" <br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        For extra security, consider using a nondescript codename for your unannounced game. Of
        course, you'll need to update the name later before your game is announced and releases its
        Coming Soon store page. <br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Release State Override keys are limited to 2,500 per app. If you need more than 2,500 keys
        for a confidential playtest, then the probability of a leak is increasing to the point where
        you're likely "announcing" your product anyway. In this case, you should instead consider
        announcing your base game first, and then running your external playtest via a normal
        playtest app, which will enable you to request up to 50,000 keys. <br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Don't Forget! Release State Override keys will continue to grant access to the base game
        until they are banned, so be sure to read up on
        <a href="/doc//features/keys#6">key management</a> and have a plan in place for your Release
        Override keys after your confidential playtest is over.
    </li>
</ol>
<div class="bb_callout">
    <div>
        <strong>Surfacing an App on Steam</strong>: Keys aside, details of an app on Steam will
        become visible to many players and/or third party web crawlers once the app: 1) publishes a
        Store page, 2) becomes available for Pre-Load or 3) gets Released, even if it is released
        with a 'Hidden' store page. Be sure to plan your announcement for <i>no later</i> than the
        first time your app enters any of these states.

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="6"></a>Common Configurations</h2>
<strong>Playtest is NOT playable and NOT accepting sign-ups. </strong> <br />
This is the default configuration when you initially set up your playtest before setting it live or
accepting sign-ups. It will also be the final configuration, once you are completely done running
your playtest.<br />
<br />
<img
    src="https://cdn.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/notplayablehidden.png"
    alt="notplayablehidden.png"
    title="notplayablehidden.png"
/><br />
<br />
<strong>Playtest is NOT playable, but is accepting new sign-ups.</strong> <br />
This is the configuration you would likely set up initially to have players sign up prior to your
playtest ever being available. You might also want this configuration if you’ve ended a playtest,
but are planning on doing another one in the future and would like to add more playtesters to the
future playtest event.<br />
<br />

    alt="notplayablevisible.png"
    title="notplayablevisible.png"
/><br />
<br />
<strong>Playtest is playable and accepting new sign-ups.</strong> <br />
This might be the right setting for when your playtest is live and you plan on adding more
playtesters in the future, perhaps you will be expanding server capacity or adding new features, and
will need more playtesters to try out a future build.<br />
<br />

    alt="playablevisible.png"
    title="playablevisible.png"
/><br />
<br />
<strong>Playtest is playable, but NOT accepting new sign-ups.</strong> <br />
You may want this configuration if you are not planning on admitting any additional playtesters in
the future but still want your current playtesters to have access to the build.<br />
<br />

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="friend_invites"></a>Friend Invites - BETA</h2>
Friend Invites is an experimental new way to add players to your Steam playtest, designed for
multiplayer games that benefit from playing with your friends.<br />
<br />
When enabled, users with access can invite their friends to join the playtest, and those friends can
invite their friends, and so on.<br />
<br />
Players can invite their friends within Steam. When invited, a player receives a notification
letting them know they have been invited by a friend to join the playtest. <br />
<br />
<img
    src="https://cdn.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/friendinvite3.png"
    alt="friendinvite3.png"
    title="friendinvite3.png"

<img
    src="https://cdn.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/friendinvite2.JPG"
    alt="friendinvite2.JPG"
    title="friendinvite2.JPG"
/><br />
<br />
<br />
Like other Steam playtest options, everything can be configured in the dashboard.<br />
<br />
<img
    src="https://cdn.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/invitefriends1.png"
    alt="invitefriends1.png"
    title="invitefriends1.png"
/><br />
<br />
Using the dashboard, you can specify the number of invites each player gets:<br />
1, 2, or 3<br />
<br />
You can also enable friend invites or pause new friend invites anytime with a few clicks.<br />
<br />
When friend invites are enabled, growth can compound quickly, so this feature is best for games with
robust server capacity.
<u
    >If you are concerned about your playtest growing too fast for you to support, this feature may
    not be for you.</u
><br />
<br />
If you want to limit Friend Invite growth, you have a few options:<br />
<ul>
    <li>
        Monitor users with access to your playtest via the playtest dashboard and pause new invites
        when you reach a number you're comfortable supporting<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Limit friend invite capability to just players who joined by a certain date, capping the
        potential number of invites. You can configure this in the Friend Invites option.
    </li>
</ul>
<br />
Example:<br />
You have configured your Friend Invites to 3 invites for each player, and you have 5,000 current
players with access to your playtest. You configure your Friend Invites to only apply to users who
have access as of today. That would limit potential invites to 15,000 total, as only users who had
access as of today can send new invites.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="7"></a>Important notes about Friend Invites</h2>
<div class="bb_callout">
    <div>
        <strong>Prerequisite: </strong>Users can only invite friends they have been friends with for
        at least 30 days.
    </div>
</div>
<div class="bb_callout">
    <div>
        <strong>Duration:</strong> Once an invite is sent, it will remain active, even if you pause
        friend invites. Pausing friend invites simply stops new invites from being sent out.
    </div>
</div>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="8"></a>Gathering Feedback From Players</h2>
Collecting feedback from players is up to you. We've seen a number of developers include a big
'feedback' button right on the main menu of their game, leading to wherever that developer wishes to
collect and manage the feedback. It could lead to a Steam forum, or it could be your discord
channel, bug tracking software, your own website forums, or wherever else you wish.<br />
<br />
We suggest you engage directly with your audience - let them know what kind of feedback you are
after and where best to share it. You can also provide links to your preferred feedback or
communication system directly in a community Announcement.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="9"></a>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<strong><h4>Q: Why did Valve decide to work on this tool?</h4></strong><br />
<strong>A:</strong> The new Steam Playtest feature came out of repeated requests from studios large
and small, for a way to run a limited, lower-risk playtest with live customers. Dev teams wanted the
freedom to run a playtest without stressing about their user reviews or interfering with their
wishlist numbers… but they also wanted the control to start, pause, and end their playtests. We hope
this new set of tools helps developers get closer to their players and make better games as a
result. <br />
<br />
We saw a number of other surprising or unofficial solutions to the same set of problems; stuff like
offering a demo that was really just an Open Beta, or shipping a free “Prologue” game to build
momentum. Devs were using whatever tools they could to build community and gather playtesting data.
Those are great problems to solve, so we want to provide an official, well-supported solution that
is easier for developers and more consistent for players. <br />
<br />
<strong><h4>Q: What if I want to run a playtest but control access via Steam keys?</h4></strong
><br />
<strong>A:</strong> You can request keys for your Steam Playtest too. In fact, this is now the
preferred method of running beta testing for your game if you need more than small group of testers.
Remember, you can still test using your game's main App ID, using release override keys. You can
find more information in the
<a href="/doc/store/testing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Testing On Steam</a> documentation.
You can view our Steam Key rules and guidelines
<a href="/doc/features/keys" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a>.<br />
<br />
<strong><h4>Q: I have a question or feedback, how do I contact you?</h4></strong><br />
<strong>A:</strong> Please use our
<a
    href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/wizard/HelpWithPublishing"
    target="_blank"
    rel="noreferrer"
    >contact form here</a
>
and let us know if you're running into an issue or have feedback on the feature.<br />
<br />
<strong><h4>Q: When can I use Steam Playtest?</h4></strong><br />
<strong>A:</strong> We think the best, and probably most common, time to use this feature is before
your game releases. Your first priority will probably be to put up a coming soon page for your game,
to start gathering wishlists and building a community. But once that’s done, Steam Playtest gives
you the option to get live player feedback prior to release.<br />
<br />
If you want, you can keep using the Playtest appID as a testing ground for new tools or features…
but remember: Steam Playtest is free for customers. Keeping your playtest up after release probably
only makes sense if your game is already free-to-play.<br />
<br />
<strong><h4>Q: How does Steam choose which playtesters to admit to a limited Playtest?</h4></strong
><br />
<strong>A:</strong> Steam will choose playtesters at random from the set of Steam accounts that have
requested access. You do have the option to select to admit players from certain countries, although
this would mostly make sense for limited server availability and addressing latency issues.<br />
<br />
<strong
    ><h4>
        Q: If a player requests access to my playtest, how will they be notified once I have granted
        them access via the playtest controls?
    </h4></strong
><br />
<strong>A:</strong> Players receive an email from Steam when they are added to a Playtest that
they've expressed interest in. They will also see their status on the store page for the base
game.<br />
<br />
<strong><h4>Q: Will players be notified when a Playtest is set to playable?</h4></strong><br />
<strong>A:</strong> Steam will not email when a build for a Playtest is set to
playable/non-playable. We recommend you use an announcement from the
<a href="/doc/marketing/event_tools" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
    >Steam Events and Announcements</a
>
system to let players know when the Playtest is playable.<br />
<br />
<strong
    ><h4>
        Q: If I'm using the Friend Invite system for my playtest, how will a user be notified if
        they receive a playtest invite from a friend?
    </h4></strong
><br />
<strong>A:</strong> Users are notified via Steam's notification system, which appears in the bell
icon in the upper right corner of Steam's desktop client (or lower right in the mobile client). They
will also see their invite status on the store page for the base game. In practice, we've found that
most friends who are looking forward to playing together will notify each other directly (for
example via text messages or social media) so the friend sending the invite can let their invited
friend know to check your base game's Store Page to accept the invite. <br />
<br />
<strong><h4>Q: How do I end a Steam Playtest?</h4></strong><br />
<strong>A:</strong> You can mark the playtest "Not playable" from the Steam Playtest page on the
partner site. Make sure to disable the store-page signup first.<br />
<br />
<strong><h4>Q: Is my Steam Playtest confidential?</h4></strong><br />
<strong>A:</strong> No - players signing up for a Playtest aren’t under nondisclosure agreements
with you, and there shouldn’t be an expectation of secrecy. If you want to run a confidential beta
and require players to agree to an NDA, you can do a few different things.<br />
<ol>
    <li>
        Use the Playtest App ID, request keys, set the Playtest to Playable and Store Visibility to
        Hidden.<br />
    </li>
    <li>Use the main game's App ID and request release override keys.</li>
</ol>
Both of these paths will require you to have your own solution for signing up and registering
players.<br />
<br />
<strong
    ><h4>
        Q: Does my Steam Playtest have a store page? Can customers find it in the store?
    </h4></strong
><br />
<strong>A:</strong> The Playtest will not have its own store page; instead, it will be listed as an
option available on the main game’s store page. That way, any search traffic, store recommendations,
etc all funnel towards the real product for users to wishlist and follow. <br />
<br />
<strong><h4>Q: Can I charge for access to my Playtest?</h4></strong><br />
A: No - the design of Steam Playtest is for free signups. And since Playtests can be deactivated at
any time, it’s not OK to monetize them with in-game transactions, or sell access. If you’re ready to
charge money for a work-in-progress version of your game, you should use Steam
<a href="/doc/store/earlyaccess" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Early Access</a>.<br />
<br />
<strong><h4>Q: How should I coordinate players for an online/multiplayer playtest?</h4></strong
><br />
<strong>A:</strong> Some multiplayer games may wish to open up servers during limited time windows,
and that’s an ok use of Steam Playtest. We’d recommend using
<a href="/doc/marketing/event_tools" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
    >Steam Events and Announcements</a
>
to talk to your players about scheduled updates or coordinated playtests.<br />

<strong><h4>Q: If I run a Steam Playtest, will it mess with my real game?</h4></strong><br />
<strong>A:</strong> Your Steam Playtest appID is a separate appID from your main game. As a result,
things like playtime, wishlists, reviews, refunds, etc. are separate as well. For example:
<ul>
    <li>
        A customer’s wishlist for your game won’t be impacted when they join or leave your
        playtest.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        A customer who has only participated in the Playtest cannot review your actual game.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        A customer’s playtime in your Playtest has no impact on the Steam Refund policy, or the
        player’s ability to get a refund on a purchase of your real game. <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        A customer’s playtime in your Playtest has no impact on earning trading cards or unlocking
        achievements. <br />
    </li>
</ul>
