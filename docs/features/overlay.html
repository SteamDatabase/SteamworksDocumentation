<h1>Steam Overlay</h1>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="overview"></a>Overview</h2>
The Steam overlay is a piece of the Steam user interface that can be activated over the top of
almost any game launched through Steam. It lets the user access the friends list, web browser, chat,
and in-game DLC purchasing.<br />
<br />
The default key for a user to access the overlay while in a game is SHIFT+TAB, but they can change
it in their Steam-&gt;Settings dialog.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="requirements"></a>Requirements</h2>
Your game does not need to do anything special for the overlay to work, it automatically hooks into
any game launched from Steam! While in development and running your game in a debugger, the overlay
is loaded when you call
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/steam_api#SteamAPI_Init" class="bb_apilink"
    >SteamAPI_Init</a
>. As such you'll need to make sure to call
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/steam_api#SteamAPI_Init" class="bb_apilink"
    >SteamAPI_Init</a
>
prior to initializing the OpenGL/D3D device, otherwise it won't be able to hook the device
creation.<br />
<br />
The overlay supports games that use DirectX 7 - 12, OpenGL, Metal, and Vulkan. The overlay will not
be active in software-rasterized games.<br />
<br />
macOS: Overlay support for 10.15 (Catalina) requires adding entitlements to your build
configuration. Details are provided on the

        <strong>NOTE:</strong> The overlay is automatically disabled for 'Software' app types. If
        you need the overlay enabled, you can do so by:<br />
        <ul class="bb_ul">
            <li>Making sure your Steam account has the Edit App Metadata permission<br /></li>
            <li>
                Navigate from the App's landing page to &gt; Edit Steamworks Settings &gt;
                Installation tab &gt; General Installation<br />
            </li>
            <li>Check box for Enable Steam Overlay for Application<br /></li>

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="activating"></a>Activating the overlay from your app</h2>
There are a set of functions in the Steamworks API that give you direct access to triggering the
game overlay.<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        <a
            href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamFriends#ActivateGameOverlay"
            class="bb_apilink"
            >ISteamFriends::ActivateGameOverlay</a
        ><br />
        This function can open the game overlay to the dialog specified.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <a
            href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamFriends#ActivateGameOverlayToUser"
            class="bb_apilink"
            >ISteamFriends::ActivateGameOverlayToUser</a
        ><br />
        This function can open the game overlay to the dialog specified, with the user passed in as
        context.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <a
            href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamFriends#ActivateGameOverlayToWebPage"
            class="bb_apilink"
            >ISteamFriends::ActivateGameOverlayToWebPage</a
        ><br />
        This function can open the game overlay to its web browser, and loads the specified url. It
        needs to be a full url, e.g.
        <a href="http://www.steamgames.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
            >http://www.steamgames.com/</a
        >.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <a
            href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamFriends#ActivateGameOverlayToStore"
            class="bb_apilink"
            >ISteamFriends::ActivateGameOverlayToStore</a
        ><br />
        This function can open the game overlay to the buy DLC for the current game (see
        <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/application/dlc" class="bb_doclink"
            >Downloadable Content (DLC)</a

        for more info)<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <a
            href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamUtils#SetOverlayNotificationPosition"
            class="bb_apilink"
            >ISteamUtils::SetOverlayNotificationPosition</a
        ><br />
        Sets which corner of the screen you want notifications ('toasts') to appear. Default is the
        bottom-right corner of the screen.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <a
            href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamUtils#IsOverlayEnabled"
            class="bb_apilink"
            >ISteamUtils::IsOverlayEnabled</a
        ><br />
        Returns true if the overlay is running &amp; the user can access it. The overlay process
        could take a few seconds to start &amp; hook the game process, so this function will
        initially return false while the overlay is loading.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="callbacks"></a>Communication from the overlay to your game</h2>
The following signals (callbacks) are sent from Steam to your game, based on user action in the
overlay:<br />

            >GameOverlayActivated_t</a

<h4>Q. Why is the Steam overlay crashing my app?</h4>
<strong>A.</strong> The Steam overlay is used in thousands of games and as such it has been very
thoroughly tested and is rarely the cause of a crash. However, because of the way it injects itself
into the game, it does often expose memory leaks or memory corruption in the usage of your rendering
API that may not have impacted game play.<br />
<br />
To diagnose overlay crashes with DirectX for example, try to determine how D3D got into a bad state
by using the d3d debug runtime with all (info/warning/error/notice) level spew turned on. It might
give some hints to orphaned d3d resources. If you don’t find anything that way there may be a more
general memory corruption issue. If these always occur on shutdown then it’s likely a shutdown
ordering issue with the game not cleaning up as it shuts down.<br />
<br />
If after debugging the app is still crashing in the overlay, please notify us in the
<a href="http://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/discussion" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
    >Steamworks Development Group</a
>.
<h4>Q. Why isn't the Steam overlay showing up in my app?</h4>
<strong>A.</strong> First ensure that you meet the
<a href="#requirements" class="bb_doclink">Requirements</a> above. If you do meet the requirements
and it's still not showing up, make sure you're launching the app through the Steam client, either
directly from the lobby/quick launch list, or by calling

    href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/steam_api#SteamAPI_RestartAppIfNecessary"
    class="bb_apilink"
    >SteamAPI_RestartAppIfNecessary</a
>.
<h4>Q. My game is using D3D12 on Win7, and the Steam overlay is not working. Why?</h4>
<strong>A.</strong> Please refer to this
<a
    href="https://microsoft.github.io/DirectX-Specs/d3d/D3D12onWin7.html#add-support-to-d3d11on12"
    target="_blank"
    rel="noreferrer"
    >Microsoft document</a
>
on how to add Steam overlay support.
<h4>Q. My game runs in a browser. Can the Overlay work in that?</h4>
<strong>A.</strong> The Steam Overlay requires a game consistently render frames, not pausing
rendering or rendering only part of the screen based on dirty rects. Unfortunately, web browsers do
not support this model. A workaround for web based games is to host an embedded Chromium inside a
native application, with a D3D window and input forwarding to the embedded Chromium. That can be
setup to render in offscreen mode, which then renders the resulting chromium texture each frame in
the native app. Partners often use CEF to do this, though this is not an easy task.
