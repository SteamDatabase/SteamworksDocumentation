using the Steam Remote Play feature with the

computer, and when inviting friends to play using

    >Remote Play Together</a
>.<br />
<br />
Each computer or device connected via Remote Play has its own session. You can find out more about
connected devices using the <a href="/doc/api/ISteamRemotePlay">ISteamRemotePlay Interface</a><br />
<br />
If you have optimized your game for remote play on various types of devices, or your game works well
with Remote Play Together, you can check the appropriate feature checkboxes in the Basic Info
section of the Store Page admin on the partner site, and your game will show up when customers
search for games that work well for those use cases.<br />

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="2"></a>Remote Play Together</h2>
<br />
Checking this feature allows users to invite their Steam Friends to join the game as though they
were sitting at the same computer playing together. Only the host needs to own and install the game,
while additional players connect through Steam Remote Play streaming technology.<br />
<br />
This feature is enabled automatically for games that are listed with Local Multiplayer, Local Co-op,
or Shared/Split Screen capability, but you can enable or disable it yourself to match whether this
feature is appropriate for your game.<br />
<br />
Users can invite friends from their friends list in the Steam overlay, and if you want, you can
create UI to invite friends directly from your game using the
<a href="/doc/api/ISteamRemotePlay#BSendRemotePlayTogetherInvite"
    >ISteamRemotePlay::BSendRemotePlayTogetherInvite</a
>() function.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="3"></a>Remote Play Testing</h2>
<br />
It's possible to use Remote Play Together and set up your game to allow the public to test it with
developers without ever getting the files downloaded to their computers. This could be used for
focus testing of new content, press walkthroughs, virtual trade shows, etc.<br />

<ol>
    <li>
        Make sure the default branch has content that you're comfortable with the public downloading
        and seeing. For an unreleased game, this should probably be an empty depot.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Create or set a password protected branch with content that you'd like to invite people to
        test remotely.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Go to the partner site, edit your game's Steamworks settings, select the Application tab,
        and choose Steam Remote Play. Select the branch that you want to use for testing, then save
        and publish your changes.<br />
        <br />

        /><br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        If your game is unreleased, send a CD-key to the users you would like to invite for testing.
        This grants them access to the default depot, so you may want to create special purpose
        accounts for this.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Set up your test system to use the password protected branch. Launch the game on the test
        system and right click people in your friends list to invite them to join the session and
        play! Each session requires a fresh invitation from the developer.
    </li>
</ol>
<br />
This walkthrough assumes that you are showcasing content, but you can also use this to enable Remote
Play Together on a branch and try it out privately before enabling it on your game in the Store Page
settings.<br />
<br />
(NOTE: this feature requires that the test system be running a Steam client dated May 23, 2020 or
newer)

blog post for some examples and best practices.<br />
<br />
<ol>
    <li>
        Begin streaming the game to your mobile device. On the desktop machine, go to Steam Big
        Picture Controller Configuration for your game. Remove any unnecessary bindings not used by
        your game, and add any custom bindings used by your game. For more information see
        <a

        /><br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        On your mobile device, click the [...] button and drag any newly bound controls onto the
        screen. Adjust the layout and size of each button as desired. For more information see the
        <a

        >.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Once you are happy with your configuration and are ready to publish it, go to Big Picture
        Controller Configuration on the desktop (while streaming to your mobile device), and click
        Export Config. Save it as a new Personal binding and give it an appropriate name such as
        'Official Touch Controller Configuration for GAME' and a useful description.<br />
    </li>
    <li>Go to Browse Configs, select your new config, and click Share Configuration.<br /></li>
    <li>
        Go to the partner site and edit Steamworks Settings → Application → Steam Input. Under Steam
        Input Default Touch Configuration select Custom Configuration. Click the "Add Custom
        Configuration" button and paste the URL for your new config, and click Save.<br />

        <br />
    </li>
    <li>Publish your updated Steamworks settings for your game, as you would normally.</li>
</ol>
<br />
If you want to change your official configuration, you have to publish a new config, as you would
with the Steam Controller.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="8"></a>HOWTO: Advanced Touch Controller Config</h2>
<br />
If your game has multiple game modes, you can set up an actionset with unique layout for each game
mode.<br />
<br />
Simply add an actionset to the touch controller configuration for your game, cycle through the
actionsets on your mobile device and setup the layout for them, and then call the SteamInput APIs to
change to the appropriate actionset at runtime.<br />
<br />
For example, if you wanted to add a menu actionset, you could do it like this:<br />

    SteamInput()-&gt;ActivateActionSet( STEAM_INPUT_HANDLE_ALL_CONTROLLERS, BInMenu() ?
    k_ActionSetMenu : k_ActionSetGame ); ... } GameQuit(); }
