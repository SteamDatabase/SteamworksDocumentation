<h1>User Authentication and Ownership</h1>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="Overview"></a>Overview</h2>
Steamworks exposes multiple methods for authenticating a Steam user's identity and verifying
ownership of an application. The following document describes each of these authentication methods
used in the following scenarios:<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        Between a game client and other clients (P2P) or game servers using
        <a href="#client_to_client" class="bb_doclink">Session Tickets</a><br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Between a game client and a backend server using:<br />
        <ul class="bb_ul">
            <li>
                <a href="#client_to_backend_webapi" class="bb_doclink"
                    >Session Tickets and the Steamworks Web API</a
                ><br />
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="#encryptedapptickets" class="bb_doclink"
                    >Encrypted Application Ticket Library</a
                ><br />
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        When a user is in a web browser using
        <a href="#website" class="bb_doclink">OpenID and Steamworks Web API</a>
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="1"></a>Identifying a user within Steam</h2>
Every Steam user can be uniquely identified by a 64-bit numeric ID, known as the user's
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">Steam ID</code>. In the Steamworks C++ APIs, a
user's SteamID is contained within a
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/steam_api#CSteamID" class="bb_apilink">CSteamID</a>
object. You can retrieve the current user's SteamID by calling
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamUser#GetSteamID" class="bb_apilink"
    >ISteamUser::GetSteamID</a
>
and then retrieve the 64-bit ID by calling
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">CSteamID.ConvertToUint64()</code> on the returned
value.<br />
<br />
The following authentication methods can be used to securely verify a user's Steam ID.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="2"></a>APIs covered in this document</h2>
<h4>Session Tickets</h4>
Session Tickets are signed tickets that can be used to verify a user's identity between the user's
game client and any number of other game clients (such as in a peer-to-peer multiplayer session) or
to a listen/dedicated game server (using the
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamGameServer" class="bb_apilink"
    >ISteamGameServer</a
>
API). These tickets can also be used to verify ownership of the current game and related
downloadable content, and determine if the user has been VAC-banned (See
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/features/anticheat" class="bb_doclink"
    >Valve Anti-Cheat (VAC) and Game Bans</a
>).<br />
Session Tickets can also be used to verify a user's identity between a game client and a secure,
backend server using the
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/webapi_overview" class="bb_doclink"
    >Steamworks Web API</a
>. Requires that the secure server can make HTTPS requests to
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">partner.steam-api.com</code>.
<h4>Encrypted Application Tickets</h4>
Encrypted Application Tickets can be used to verify a user's identity between a game client and a
secure, backend server. Unlike Session Tickets, verifying Encrypted Application Tickets does
<i>not</i> require that the secure server can make HTTPS requests. Instead, a C++ library and a
private, symmetric key are used by the secure server to verify the ticket. The Steamworks SDK
includes 32-bit and 64-bit versions of this library for Windows and Linux under the
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">public/steam/lib</code> directory.<br />
<br />
Before using Encrypted Application Tickets, you must generate a private key for each title. You can
do this by navigating to Edit Steamworks Settings for your application and selecting 'SDK Auth' from
the 'Security' drop-down. This key will be associated with your title's AppID and any downloadable
content for that title. In order to access this section of Steamworks, a user must have the "Manage
Signing" permission for the relevant Application.
<div class="bb_callout">
    <div>
        NOTE: These keys must be stored securely, and must not be distributed within your
        application in any way!
    </div>
</div>
<h4>Steamworks Web API</h4>
Steam exposes an HTTP based Web API which can be used to access many Steamworks features. The API
contains public methods that can be accessed from any application capable of making an HTTP request,
such as game client or server. The API also contains protected methods that require authentication
and are intended to be accessed from trusted back-end applications. More details on the Web API can
be found <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/webapi_overview" class="bb_doclink">here</a>.

<h4>User Authentication</h4>
The following steps detail how to use Session Tickets to verify a user's identity between the user's
game client (client A) and another client or game server (client B):<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        Client A must retrieve a session ticket by calling
        <a
            href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamUser#GetAuthSessionTicket"
            class="bb_apilink"
            >ISteamUser::GetAuthSessionTicket</a
        >.<br />
    </li>
    <li>Client A must send its session ticket to client B.<br /></li>
    <li>
        Client B must pass client A's ticket to
        <a
            href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamUser#BeginAuthSession"
            class="bb_apilink"
            >ISteamUser::BeginAuthSession</a
        >, which will perform a quick validity check. If the ticket is valid, then
        <a
            href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamUser#BeginAuthSession"
            class="bb_apilink"
            >ISteamUser::BeginAuthSession</a
        >
        will forward the ticket to then the Steam backend to verify that the ticket has not been
        reused and was issued by the account owner of client A. The result of this verification will
        be returned in a
        <a
            href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamUser#ValidateAuthTicketResponse_t"
            class="bb_apilink"
            >ISteamUser::ValidateAuthTicketResponse_t</a
        >
        callback.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        When the multiplayer session terminates:<br />
        <ul class="bb_ul">
            <li>
                Client A must pass the handle initially returned from
                <a
                    href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamUser#GetAuthSessionTicket"

                    >ISteamUser::GetAuthSessionTicket</a
                >
                to
                <a
                    href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamUser#CancelAuthTicket"
                    class="bb_apilink"
                    >ISteamUser::CancelAuthTicket</a
                >.<br />
            </li>
            <li>
                Client B must pass the SteamID of client A to
                <a
                    href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamUser#EndAuthSession"

                    >ISteamUser::EndAuthSession</a
                >.<br />
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<br />
A few important notes about Session Tickets:<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        Session Tickets must only be used once.
        <a
            href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamUser#GetAuthSessionTicket"
            class="bb_apilink"
            >ISteamUser::GetAuthSessionTicket</a
        >
        must be called for every client in the mulitplayer session who requests a ticket.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        When used to authenticate players within a peer-to-peer multiplayer session, each game
        client should verify the identity of every other game client in the multiplayer session.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        When finished with a Session Ticket,
        <a
            href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamUser#CancelAuthTicket"
            class="bb_apilink"
            >ISteamUser::CancelAuthTicket</a
        >
        must be called for every handle returned by
        <a
            href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamUser#GetAuthSessionTicket"
            class="bb_apilink"
            >ISteamUser::GetAuthSessionTicket</a
        >.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        When client A calls
        <a
            href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamUser#CancelAuthTicket"
            class="bb_apilink"
            >ISteamUser::CancelAuthTicket</a
        >, client B will receive a
        <a
            href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamUser#ValidateAuthTicketResponse_t"
            class="bb_apilink"

        >
        callback stating that client A's ticket is no longer valid.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        When client A leaves a game with client B, if client A's call of
        <a
            href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamUser#CancelAuthTicket"
            class="bb_apilink"
            >ISteamUser::CancelAuthTicket</a

        is processed before client B call's of
        <a

            class="bb_apilink"
            >ISteamUser::EndAuthSession</a
        >, then client B may receive a
        <a
            href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamUser#ValidateAuthTicketResponse_t"
            class="bb_apilink"
            >ISteamUser::ValidateAuthTicketResponse_t</a
        >
        callback stating that the ticket was cancelled. Because there is mutual agreement that
        client A is leaving, this callback can be ignored.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Network conditions may prevent the Steam backend from providing a callback to the caller of
        <a
            href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamUser#BeginAuthSession"
            class="bb_apilink"
            >ISteamUser::BeginAuthSession</a
        >
        for an indefinite period of time. The caller of
        <a
            href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamUser#BeginAuthSession"
            class="bb_apilink"

        >
        ( client B ) should not assume that he knows the true identity of client A until this
        callback has been received, but should allow the multiplayer session to continue.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        If the caller of

        callback stating that the ticket for client A is invalid, the caller must refuse to continue
        the multiplayer session with client A. If the other peers in the game do not also refuse to
        play with client A, the caller should leave the multiplayer session.<br />

        exposes the same Session Ticket methods to perform authentication between a game client and
        game server.
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>Ownership Verification</h4>
When using Session Tickets, Steam will automatically verify ownership of the current AppID. If the
user does not own the current AppID, then
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">m_eAuthSessionResponse</code> field of the
<a
    href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamUser#ValidateAuthTicketResponse_t"
    class="bb_apilink"
    >ISteamUser::ValidateAuthTicketResponse_t</a

will be set to
<a
    href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/steam_api#k_EAuthSessionResponseNoLicenseOrExpired"
    class="bb_apilink"
    >k_EAuthSessionResponseNoLicenseOrExpired</a
>. After receiving a user's Session Ticket and passing it to
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamUser#BeginAuthSession" class="bb_apilink"
    >ISteamUser::BeginAuthSession</a
>
then,
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamUser#UserHasLicenseForApp" class="bb_apilink"
    >ISteamUser::UserHasLicenseForApp</a
>
can be used to determine if the user owns a specific piece of downloadable content.

<h4>User Authentication</h4>
The following steps detail how to use Session Tickets to verify a user's identity between the user's
game client and a secure server:<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        The client must retrieve a session ticket by calling
        <a
            href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamUser#GetAuthTicketForWebApi"
            class="bb_apilink"
            >ISteamUser::GetAuthTicketForWebApi</a
        >.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        To guarantee a valid ticket, the client must wait for the
        <a
            href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamUser#GetTicketForWebApiResponse_t"
            class="bb_apilink"
            >ISteamUser::GetTicketForWebApiResponse_t</a
        >
        callback.<br />
    </li>
    <li>The client must send its session ticket to the secure server.<br /></li>
    <li>
        The secure server must make an HTTPS request to
        <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">partner.steam-api.com</code> and call the
        <a
            href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/webapi/ISteamUserAuth#AuthenticateUserTicket"
            class="bb_apilink"
            >ISteamUserAuth/AuthenticateUserTicket</a
        >
        web method, passing the user's session ticket as a hex encoded UTF-8 string. Please note
        that this method allows either a
        <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/dev" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
            >Steam Web API Key</a
        >
        or a

            href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/webapi_overview/auth#publisher-keys"
            class="bb_doclink"
            >Web API Publisher Key</a
        >
        that is associated with the AppID for the provided ticket to be passed in. A future update
        to this API may return more information to the caller when a Web API Publisher key is
        supplied.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        If the user's ticket is valid, then
        <a

            class="bb_apilink"
            >ISteamUserAuth/AuthenticateUserTicket</a
        >
        will return the user's 64-bit SteamID.
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>Ownership Verification</h4>
Once a user's identity has been verified, a secure server can use the
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/webapi/ISteamUser#CheckAppOwnership" class="bb_apilink"
    >ISteamUser/CheckAppOwnership</a
>
Web API method to check if the user owns a particular AppID, or call

    href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/webapi/ISteamUser#GetPublisherAppOwnership"
    class="bb_apilink"
    >ISteamUser/GetPublisherAppOwnership</a

The following steps detail how to use Encrypted Application Tickets to verify a user's identity
between the user's game client and a secure server:<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        The client must call

Steam will only create Encrypted Application Tickets for users who own the AppID for which the
ticket was created. After decrypting an Encrypted Application Ticket, the secure server can use
<a
    href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/SteamEncryptedAppTicket#BIsTicketForApp"
    class="bb_apilink"
    >SteamEncryptedAppTicket::BIsTicketForApp</a
>
to verify the AppID of the ticket matches the title's AppID. The server can also use
<a
    href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/SteamEncryptedAppTicket#BUserOwnsAppInTicket"
    class="bb_apilink"
    >SteamEncryptedAppTicket::BUserOwnsAppInTicket</a
>
to determine if the user owns a specific piece of
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/application/dlc" class="bb_doclink"
    >Downloadable Content (DLC)</a
>.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="website"></a>Web Browser based authentication with OpenID</h2>
Steam is an <a href="http://openid.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">OpenID</a> Provider, as
described in the OpenID 2.0 specification. Inside a web browser, a third-party website can use
OpenID to obtain a user's SteamID which can be used as the login credentials for the 3rd party
website, or linked to an existing account on that website.<br />
<br />
When using OpenID, the user begins in a web browser at the third-party website. When the user wishes
to login/link their account to that website, using OpenID, the site directs the user to a login form
on the Steam Community website. Once the user has entered their Steam login credentials, the user's
web browser is automatically redirected back to the 3rd party website with some additional OpenID
specific data appended to the return URL. The site's OpenID library can then use this data to verify
and obtain the user's SteamID.<br />
<br />
Steam provides the following images which may be used by 3rd party sites when linking to the Steam
sign in page:<br />

<h4>User Authentication</h4>
Steam's OpenID 2.0 implementation can be used to link a users Steam account to their account on the
third-party website.<br />
A list of open source OpenID libraries can be found at the
<a href="http://openid.net/developers/libraries/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">OpenID website</a
>. To use OpenID to verify a user's identity:<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        Configure your OpenID library to use the following URL as Steam's OP Endpoint URL:
        <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">https://steamcommunity.com/openid/</code
        ><br />
    </li>
    <li>
        After a user has been authenticated, the user's Claimed ID will contain the user's SteamID.
        The Steam Claimed ID format is:
        <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight"
            >http://steamcommunity.com/openid/id/&lt;steamid&gt;</code
        >.
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>Ownership Verification</h4>
Once a user's identity has been verified, a secure server can use the
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/webapi/ISteamUser#CheckAppOwnership" class="bb_apilink"
    >ISteamUser/CheckAppOwnership</a
>
Web API method to check if the user owns a particular AppID, or call
<a
    href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/webapi/ISteamUser#GetPublisherAppOwnership"
    class="bb_apilink"
    >ISteamUser/GetPublisherAppOwnership</a

    <a name="account_linking"></a>Linking third-party accounts to Steam accounts
</h2>
Third-party accounts can be linked to Steam accounts by associating a user's SteamID with the 3rd
party account.<br />
<br />
A user's SteamID can be securely retrieved either in-game or through a web browser and once the
initial association has occurred, you can safely allow access to the 3rd party account by merely
verifying a user's SteamID. This eliminates the need for Steam users to do any sort of secondary
login to 3rd party account systems. Additionally, if new 3rd party accounts can be automatically
created and linked when a new SteamID is encountered, the Steam user will never have to be aware
that a secondary authentication is taking place at all. Instead, their single Steam account can
grant access to all of their games, streamlining the user experience and removing potential barriers
to installing and trying new games.

        >.<br />
    </li>
    <li>

    <a name="migration"></a>Migrating from Third-Party CD Keys to native Steam Ownership Checks
</h2>
Steam itself has a number of ways a title can authenticate a user with, removing the need for a
third-party CD key. We've compiled a list of common use cases for CD Keys and how you might
implement each case natively with Steam:
<h4>Private Forum Access</h4>
You'll want to have users login directly with their Steam account using OpenID. OpenID will return
the user's 64bit SteamID which can then be used with
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/webapi/ISteamUser#CheckAppOwnership" class="bb_apilink"
    >ISteamUser/CheckAppOwnership</a
>
to verify the user owns your appid. More details can be found above at
<a href="#account_linking" class="bb_doclink">Linking 3rd party accounts to Steam accounts</a>.
<h4>Unlocking a non-Steam, DRM-free build of a game</h4>
Use OpenID and
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/webapi/ISteamUser#CheckAppOwnership" class="bb_apilink"
    >ISteamUser/CheckAppOwnership</a
>
(<a href="#account_linking" class="bb_doclink">documented above</a>) to unlock the content on your
own site. Alternatively, you could upload the DRM-free build as optional, free DLC.
<h4>The software is sold on my own web site and unlocks with a key</h4>
You'll want to have users login directly with their Steam account using OpenID. OpenID will return
the user's 64bit SteamID which can then be used with
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/webapi/ISteamUser#CheckAppOwnership" class="bb_apilink"
    >ISteamUser/CheckAppOwnership</a
>
to verify the user owns your appid. More details can be found in
<a href="#account_linking" class="bb_doclink">Linking third-party accounts to Steam accounts</a>
above.
<h4>Dropping in-game items for registering your third-party key</h4>
If you are using the
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/features/inventory" class="bb_doclink"
    >Steam Inventory Service</a
>, make sure the item's itemdef is configured correctly as a promo item and call
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamInventory#AddPromoItem" class="bb_apilink"
    >ISteamInventory::AddPromoItem</a
>
from the client.<br />
If you have your own item backend, you can call
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamUser#GetAuthSessionTicket" class="bb_apilink"
    >ISteamUser::GetAuthSessionTicket</a
>
from the game client and then use
<a
    href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/webapi/ISteamUserAuth#AuthenticateUserTicket"
    class="bb_apilink"
    >ISteamUserAuth/AuthenticateUserTicket</a
>
with
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/webapi/ISteamUser#CheckAppOwnership" class="bb_apilink"
    >ISteamUser/CheckAppOwnership</a
>
to verify ownership. <a href="#client_to_backend_webapi" class="bb_doclink">More Information...</a>
<h4>The key controls which version of the software is unlocked</h4>
Each version of your game should have its own AppID. From the game client, call
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamUser#GetAuthSessionTicket" class="bb_apilink"
    >ISteamUser::GetAuthSessionTicket</a
>
and then use
<a
    href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/webapi/ISteamUserAuth#AuthenticateUserTicket"
    class="bb_apilink"
    >ISteamUserAuth/AuthenticateUserTicket</a
>
with
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/webapi/ISteamUser#CheckAppOwnership" class="bb_apilink"
    >ISteamUser/CheckAppOwnership</a
>
to verify ownership. <a href="#client_to_backend_webapi" class="bb_doclink">More Information...</a>
