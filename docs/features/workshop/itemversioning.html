<h1>Steam Workshop Item Versioning</h1>
By default, users who subscribe to a Steam Workshop item will download the latest version of that
item. Any subsequent updates to the item will also be propagated to all current subscribers.<br />
<br />
With the release of version 1.60 of the Steamworks SDK, content creators can now specify that a
specific version of their item is valid for a Steam (beta) branch. When uploading a version of an
item, simply call
<a href="/doc/api/ISteamUGC#SetRequiredGameVersions">ISteamUGC::SetRequiredGameVersions</a> with a
<i>minimum</i> and <i>maximum</i> Steam branch. These branches can be the same if the item is only
valid for a specific Steam branch. If the <i>minimum</i> branch is not set, then the item is valid
for all Steam branches older than the <i>maximum</i> branch, and vice-versa for when the
<i>maximum</i> branch is not set. Content creators can also set the <i>minimum</i> and
<i>maximum</i> branches for their items on the web page for their item under the "Change Notes"
section.<br />
<br />
Users who have opted into Steam branch will download the version of the item that is valid for that
branch. If the content creator updates a version of an item, all subscribers who have opted into the
Steam branch associated with that item will download those changes.<br />
<br />
To get the most out of this feature, you will need to order your Steam branches on the Steamworks
site by visiting the SteamPipe &gt; Builds page. From there you can re-order the branches you've
created from oldest to newest. This is needed if you want users to be able to specify that a version
of their item is valid for a range of branches (i.e. "minimum" and "maximum") instead of just one
specific branch.
