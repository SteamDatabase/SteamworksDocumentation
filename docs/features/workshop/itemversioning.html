<h1>Steam Workshop Item Versioning</h1>
By default, users who subscribe to a Steam Workshop item will download the latest version of that
item. Any subsequent updates to the item will also be propagated to all current subscribers.<br />
<br />
With the release of version 1.60 of the Steamworks SDK, content creators can now specify that a
specific version of their item is valid for a Steam (beta) branch. When uploading a version of an
item, simply call
<a href="/doc/api/ISteamUGC#SetRequiredGameVersions">ISteamUGC::SetRequiredGameVersions</a> with a
<i>minimum</i> and <i>maximum</i> Steam branch. These branches can be the same if the item is only
valid for a specific Steam branch. If the <i>minimum</i> branch is not set, then the item is valid
for all Steam branches older than the <i>maximum</i> branch, and vice-versa for when the
<i>maximum</i> branch is not set. Content creators can also set the <i>minimum</i> and
<i>maximum</i> branches for their items on the web page for their item under the "Change Notes"
section.<br />
<br />
Users who have opted into Steam branch will download the version of the item that is valid for that
branch. If the content creator updates a version of an item, all subscribers who have opted into the
Steam branch associated with that item will download those changes.<br />
<br />
To get the most out of this feature, you will need to order your Steam branches on the Steamworks
site by visiting the SteamPipe &gt; Builds page. From there you can re-order the branches you've
created from oldest to newest. This is needed if you want users to be able to specify that a version
of their item is valid for a range of branches (i.e. "minimum" and "maximum") instead of just one
specific branch.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sometimes not all workshop items are updated by the original authors to work with a new version of
your game. Since Steam automatically updates all games before launch, some popular workshop items
might not work anymore. As a developer you can allow users to download previous versions of your
game using app beta branches. Previously an app beta branch required the user to go to your game
properties in Steam and selected the correct version. Now there is new API that lets you query
available app branches from within the game and also let you change the beta branch for your game.
Setting a beta branch from within the game which will require a game restart so Steam can download
and apply the update. Use <a href="/doc/api/ISteamApps#GetNumBetas">ISteamApps::GetNumBetas</a> and
<a href="/doc/api/ISteamApps#GetBetaInfo">ISteamApps::GetBetaInfo</a> to iterate currently available
app beta branches. If you game detects that the user as workshop items installed that do not work
with the current version of the game, you can give the user the option to switch back to a previous
version in the game. It's up to the game to find the correct beta branch that would work with the
installed workshop items.
