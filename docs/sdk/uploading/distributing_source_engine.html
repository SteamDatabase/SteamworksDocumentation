<h1>Distributing Source Engine Games / Mods</h1>
A <strong>mod</strong>, short for <strong>modification</strong>, is an alteration or creation of
files within a game that alters aspects such as gameplay, graphics, environments, models, and more.
Many of Valve's first-party games come with a software development kit (SDK) to support the creation
of mods.<br />
<br />
The legal guidelines for modding our games are outlined in the
<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/subscriber_agreement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
    >Steam Subscriber Agreement</a
>
and within the modding tools we provide. However, we often receive recurring questions from the
community about modding, particularly when mods are intended to be distributed on Steam.<br />
<br />
Our expectation for mods is that by default they are non-commercial in nature and are based on the
official SDK for one of our games.
<h4>Non-commercial</h4>
By "non-commercial," we mean that anyone who owns the original Valve game can download and play the
mod for free. Your mod should not be used to support a commercial endeavor. If your mod includes
paid advertising or requires payment, whether in the game itself or outside of it, it is considered
commercial. If a player can receive items, features, or gameplay after making a payment of any kind
or a “donation,” it is considered a commercial use.
<h4>Based on the Official SDK</h4>
We provide SDKs for many of our games, and these are the approved tools for modding. It’s important
to note that shipping a mod based on leaked or stolen source code is not permitted.<br />
As long as you follow these guidelines, you can freely distribute your mod through Steam, your own
website, or any third-party service without needing a separate license from Valve.

            Q. I wish to distribute a Source Engine Mod through Steam. Should I fill out the

        >to get signed up as a Steamworks developer. All information is required, including bank and
        tax information and app fee even if you intend to distribute your mod for free.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Q. Is there a licensing fee for using the Source Engine?</h4>
        <strong>A.</strong> There are no fees for using the Source Engine for your free mod.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>
            Q. I’ve got a Source mod that I want to distribute via Steam. How do I prepare my mod
            under my app ID?
        </h4>
        <strong>A.</strong> You'll need to copy the exe and content from the Valve Source Engine
        game you have built your mod off of and wrap that up as your application.<br />
        While you should include all the necessary Source Engine dlls and content from the base
        Source game that you need for your mod to run, Source Engine mods must be configured to
        require ownership of the base game in order to play. This needs to be configured by
        Valve.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Q. I wish to use Steam achievements in my mod. How do I do that?</h4>
        <strong>A.</strong> Use the
        <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">CAchievementMgr</code> class included in
        the Source Engine after configuring achievements in your App Admin page on the partner site.

    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Q. How does the dedicated server work for my game?</h4>
        <strong>A.</strong> You will need a new dedicated server app ID so that you can create
        depots that are for a dedicated server. Once you've got an app ID for your base game, you
        can create your own dedicated server app ID. From your app landing page in Steamworks, click
        "All Associated Packages, DLC, Demos, And Tools" and then click the "Create New Tool" button
        in the Tools section.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Q. Can I use Valve IP in my Source Mod?</h4>
        <strong>A.</strong> Yes. However, please make it clear on your store pages that your mod is
        a mod and not created by Valve. Commercial games and mods that include Valve IP such as
        characters and story-lines need prior approval from Valve.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Q. Can I use multiple Valve IPs in one Source Mod?</h4>
        <strong>A.</strong> Yes. <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Q: How can I get source code access from Valve?</h4>
        <strong>A.</strong> We have in the past granted access to the source code of some of our
        games to a small number of modding teams who could demonstrate a need that could not be met
        by the SDK. We may do this again in the future under exceptional circumstances, but because
        of the associated support burden and risk of leaks, our default answer is to develop based
        on the SDK. <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Q: Can I sell my mod on Steam / outside of Steam?</h4>
        <strong>A.</strong> We receive this question quite regularly, but very rarely permit mods to
        be sold; the reason being is that it sets an expectation that Valve has assigned a level of
        oversight and quality control over the development and ongoing support of the mod that we
        are unable to provide. <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>
            Q: Does my mod have to require ownership of the (modded) base game when I distribute my
            mod on Steam?
        </h4>
        <strong>A.</strong> This depends. If your mod is essentially an improvement or extension of
        the underlying game, then we will require the ownership of this base game. However, if you
        are distributing a total conversion mod that does not use our games' assets or your mod is
        otherwise a completely separate experience from the base game, then we may let it ship on
        Steam without additional formal dependencies. <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Q: Why are there mods on Steam that do not follow these rules?</h4>
        <strong>A.</strong> Our approach has evolved over time and the projects you are thinking
        about have been grandfathered in. <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Q: What about mods for games on Steam that were not developed by Valve?</h4>
        <strong>A.</strong> Please contact the publisher of the game in question directly. <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Q. Where can I learn more about Source Engine development?</h4>
        <strong>A.</strong> The best place to start is on the

        <h4>Q: How can I ask you questions not answered here?</h4>

<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        <h4>Q. Where do I get the TF2 SDK?</h4>
        <strong>A.</strong> The TF2 SDK is part of the Source SDK 2013, which is available on
        <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/source-sdk-2013" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
            >Github</a
        >
        or via <a href="steam://rungameid/243750">Steam</a> .<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Q. What access does the TF2 SDK have to players item inventories?</h4>
        <strong>A.</strong> The SDK can access a read-only version of any player's inventory who
        runs the mod, to get a list of items that the player is allowed to equip. This happens
        automatically in the default build of the SDK with TF2, but the mod maker will have control
        over what is actually used in the game. Mods cannot add or remove items from a TF2 player,
        nor modify any details of an item. A mod can control which items are equipped, have small
        changes or completely re-imagine what they do within the mod.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Q. Can playing a TF2 mod change my inventory or load-out?</h4>
        <strong>A.</strong> Mods cannot change your loadout, inventory or properties of items in TF2
        proper.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Q. Can I make a TF2 mod where there are no items?</h4>
        <strong>A.</strong> Yes, a mod can disable some or all the econ items, or some of the items.
        It really depends on what the mod is trying to accomplish - for a lot of mods it's likely
        better to let players use their TF2 items, since players have a lot invested and will be
        more interested in the mod if their cosmetics come over.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Q. Can I make a TF2 mod where players can access all the TF2 items?</h4>
        <strong>A.</strong> Workshop contributors and players both have a lot of investment in their
        items, and that is something we want to continue to respect. We won't be allowing TF2 mods
        that are based around manipulating the items or economy.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Q. Can my mod redistribute TF2 game files?</h4>
        <strong>A.</strong> No. TF2 mods can only redistribute their own game files, and load TF2
        content from a local install. Players will need TF2 installed to play any TF2 mod.
    </li>
</ul>
