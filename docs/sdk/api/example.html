<h1>Steamworks API Example Application (SpaceWar)</h1>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Overview</h2>
In order to help developers understand the usage of the Steamworks API we have included source code
for a fully functional version of the classic <strong>Spacewar!</strong> multi-player shooter game.
It is a simple 2D game with support for up to 4 players and provides a perfect opportunity to
showcase many of the APIs available in the Steamworks SDK.<br />
<br />
As you look through the code keep in mind that our goal was to write a simple, stripped-down game so
we could showcase the Steamworks API as clearly as possible. You won't find any magnificent new
graphics tech here; instead we hope you'll find clear examples of how deeply to integrate Steamworks
functionality into your own projects.<br />
<br />
The APIs and Steamworks features demonstrated in the example code include:<br />
<ul>
    <li>Cloud<br /></li>
    <li>Community Integration (avatars, friends names, etc)<br /></li>
    <li>Crash Reporting<br /></li>
    <li>Friends<br /></li>
    <li>HTML Surface<br /></li>
    <li>Inventory<br /></li>
    <li>Leaderboards<br /></li>
    <li>Matchmaking (Both lobbies and server browser)<br /></li>
    <li>Multi-Player Authentication (4 players supported in-game)<br /></li>
    <li>Networking<br /></li>
    <li>Stats &amp; Achievements<br /></li>
    <li>Voice Chat</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="2"></a>Building &amp; running the example</h2>
Requirements:<br />
<ul>
    <li>Visual Studio 2005 or newer.<br /></li>
    <li>DirectX SDK<br /></li>
    <li>
        Steamworks SDK. (<a href="/downloads/steamworks_sdk.zip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
            >Download</a
        >
        the latest release.)
    </li>
</ul>
<br />
Once you have downloaded and extracted the Steamworks SDK package, find the sub-directory named
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">SteamworksExample</code>. Inside of this directory
you'll find <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">SteamworksExample.sln</code>, which can
be opened in Visual Studio. Open the solution and compile the project. If compilation succeeds then
you're ready to go and can run the project directly from Visual Studio (you'll need to have Steam
running in the background). If the build or execution fails try one of the tips below.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="3"></a>Common Build Problems</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Cannot open include file: 'd3d9.h'</strong><br />
        If you encounter this error it means that your systems include path does not include the D3D
        include path, or that you have not installed the D3D SDK. First, make sure you have
        downloaded and installed the DirectX SDK. Once the SDK is installed you need to set up the
        include path. You can do this system wide via the standard Visual Studio environment
        variables, or you can set them up just for the SteamworksExample project by editing the
        project properties.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Fatal error LNK1104: cannot open file 'd3d9.lib'</strong><br />
        If you encounter this error it means that your systems library path does not include the D3D
        library directory. See the instructions above, except you need to update the library path
        instead of the include path.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong
            >Steam must be running to play this game (<a href="/doc/api/steam_api#SteamAPI_Init"
                >SteamAPI_Init</a
            >
            failed).</strong
        ><br />
        If you encounter this error when running the game, make sure that Steam is running. If Steam
        is running, ensure there is a
        <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">steam_appid.txt</code> file in the
        directory with the game executable. This file ships with the SDK example and should be
        present if you run from within Visual Studio or directly from the Debug or Release sub
        directories.<br />
        <br />
        When you are launching the game from the exe directly, outside of the Steam UI this file
        must be present and must contain a single line with the game's AppID (for your games, Valve
        will assign each an AppID, the example game's AppID is 480). When you ship your own game
        through Steam this file will not be needed as Steam will auto-detect your AppID when the
        game is launched.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong
            >The application has failed to start because steam_api.dll was not found. Re-installing
            the application may fix this problem.</strong
        ><br />
        In order to run successfully
        <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">steam_api.dll</code> must be located in the
        same directory as the example game executable. This will also be true for your own games
        which utilize Steamworks. The Visual Studio project file should place the executable in the
        appropriate directory when building, but if you are using a different compiler or have
        modified the solution or project files you may need to copy it yourself. You can
        redistribute <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">steam_api.dll</code> with your
        own Steamworks games when shipping them.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong
            >The application has failed to start because d3dx_??.dll was not found. Re-installing
            the application may fix this problem.</strong
        ><br />
        The example relies on the D3D9X helper library which ships with the DirectX SDK. If you run
        the example on the same machine you have built it on the library should be found
        automatically. If you copy your compiled binary to another machine you may need to install
        the D3D redistributables to obtain the same version of D3D9X that you compiled against on
        your development machine.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="4"></a>Code Overview</h2>
Once you have the <strong>Spacewar!</strong> example project compiling and running you'll want to
start looking at the code. If you browse the files within the Visual Studio solution explorer you'll
see that the code has been broken up into Game and Engine code. You can ignore the code in the
Engine folder - it supports basic 2D rendering via D3D and basic keyboard input. All of the
important code documenting Steamworks API usage is files in the Game folder.<br />
<br />
The most interesting areas to begin looking at the code are described briefly below:<br />
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong
            ><code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">Main.cpp</code> -- Main entry point
            for the example game.</strong
        ><br />
        API Usage shown:<br />
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Client API Initialization</strong> -- You'll need to initialize the API
                early during app startup, and you'll see how this is done inside of the
                <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">RealMain()</code> function in
                <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">Main.cpp</code>.<br />
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>API Error/Warning logging</strong> -- During development you may want to get
                some logging output from the Steam APIs in order to help debug problems. You can see
                an example of setting up debug logging inside the
                <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">RealMain()</code> function where
                <a href="/doc/api/ISteamClient#SetWarningMessageHook"
                    >ISteamClient::SetWarningMessageHook</a
                >
                is called.<br />
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Crash reporting</strong> -- You may wish to use Steam's built in minidump
                crash reporting in your games. If you do you'll find an example of installing the
                exception handler and setting up minidump writing in
                <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">WinMain()</code> and
                <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">MiniDumpFunction()</code> within
                <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">Main.cpp</code>.<br />
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong
            ><code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">SpaceWarServer.cpp/h</code> -- Server
            code for the example game.</strong
        ><br />
        API Usage shown:<br />
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Gameserver API Initialization</strong> -- Inside game servers you'll want to
                initialize a stripped down version of the API that doesn't have the individual user
                interfaces exposed. You'll find this done in the constructor for
                <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">CSpaceWarServer</code> in
                <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">SpaceWarServer.cpp</code>.<br />
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Running API Callbacks</strong> -- In your games you'll want to periodically
                run Steam callbacks to process results from Steam's asynchronous API calls. You'll
                find an example of running callbacks in a game server via
                <a href="/doc/api/steam_gameserver#SteamGameServer_RunCallbacks"
                    >SteamGameServer_RunCallbacks</a
                >
                in the
                <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">CSpaceWarServer::RunFrame()</code>
                function, and you'll find examples of handling individual callbacks and registering
                them inside the
                <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">CSpaceWarServer</code> constructor
                code and header file.<br />
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Multi-Player Authentication (VAC Ban handling)</strong> -- If your game is
                an online multi-player game then you'll want to confirm that users own the game
                before you let them join an online server. You'll find callback handlers and calls
                to the <a href="/doc/api/ISteamGameServer">ISteamGameServer</a> API used within
                <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">SpaceWarServer.cpp</code> for these
                purposes. You'll also see how to handle deny and kick responses that Steam may send
                you due to users not owning your product, or due to users being banned or needing to
                be kicked for cheating.<br />
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Networking API</strong> -- If you are building an online game you may want
                to utilize Steam's built in networking APIs. You'll find examples of their usage
                server side in game servers via
                <a href="/doc/api/ISteamNetworking">ISteamNetworking</a> API calls using the
                <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">SteamGameServerNetworking()</code>
                accessor and callbacks within
                <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">SpaceWarServer.cpp</code>.<br />
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Matchmaking and Master Server communication</strong> -- If you are building
                a multi-player game and wish to utilize the Steam server browser, then your game
                server will need to communicate with the Steam Master Servers. You'll find examples
                of doing this in the
                <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">CSpaceWarServer</code> constructor
                and in the
                <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight"
                    >CSpaceWarServer::SendUpdatedServerDetailsToSteam()</code
                >
                method.<br />
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong
            ><code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">SpaceWarClient.cpp/h</code> -- Client
            side code for the example game.</strong
        ><br />
        API Usage shown:<br />
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Matchmaking via Lobbies</strong> -- In your online games you may wish to
                include matchmaking via lobbies in addition to, or instead of, the Server Browser.
                You'll find examples of using the lobby code and callbacks via the
                <a href="/doc/api/ISteamMatchmaking">ISteamMatchmaking</a> interface inside of
                <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">SpaceWarClient.cpp</code>. You'll
                also want to look at
                <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">Lobby.cpp/h</code> which include
                some of the code for handling state and callbacks once inside a given lobby.<br />
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Friends &amp; Community Integration</strong> -- Steam allows you to use rich
                identity information for players, including their persona name and personal avatar,
                within your game. You'll find an example of integrating persona names and avatars
                into scoreboards via the
                <a href="/doc/api/ISteamFriends">ISteamFriends</a> interface inside of
                <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">SpaceWarClient.cpp</code><br />
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Networking API</strong> -- You'll find an example of client side usage of
                the Steam Networking API inside of
                <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">SpaceWarClient.cpp</code> (see
                <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">SpaceWarServer.cpp</code> for the
                server side implementation).<br />
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong
            ><code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">StatsAndAchievements.cpp/h</code> --
            Stats and Achievement handling for the example game.</strong
        ><br />
        API Usage shown:<br />
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Stats &amp; Achievements</strong> -- You'll find an implementation of both
                Stats and Achievements handling within
                <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">StatsAndAchievements.cpp</code>.
                The file contains the
                <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">CStatsAndAchievements</code> class,
                which is called with updated state information from
                <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">CSpaceWarClient</code>. Once
                <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">CStatsAndAchievements</code> has
                received state change information from the game client, it handles notifying Steam
                of changes to user stats or achievements obtained via the
                <a href="/doc/api/ISteamUserStats">ISteamUserStats</a> interface.<br />
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong
            ><code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">Lobby.cpp/h</code> -- Matchmaking via
            Lobbies</strong
        ><br />
        API Usage shown:<br />
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Matchmaking via Lobbies</strong> -- You'll find part of the example game's
                lobby-based matchmaking implementation in
                <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">Lobby.cpp</code>.
                <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">Lobby.cpp</code> works closely with
                <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">SpaceWarClient.cpp</code> to handle
                matchmaking so you'll want to look at both of them. When examining the lobby code,
                take special note of the callbacks and calls to
                <a href="/doc/api/ISteamMatchmaking">ISteamMatchmaking</a> interface methods.<br />
            </li>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Matchmaking via ServerBrowser</strong> -- If you support matchmaking via the
                Server Browser then you'll probably want to provide a server browser listing
                directly inside your game to supplement the listing provided by the Steam UI. You'll
                find an example of getting the list of Internet servers for your game and displaying
                it to the user inside
                <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">ServerBrowser.cpp.</code><br />

            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<br />
If your game has an existing authentication and matchmaking engine that you will keep using then you
may want to remove the
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">USE_GS_AUTH_API</code> define from
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">Spacewars.h</code>. When you remove this define it
will cause the sample to NOT use Steam authentication or matchmaking but you will still be able to
access other Steam functionality such as achievements and friends information, look at the code for
details.
