<h1>Creating and using InstallScripts</h1>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="basics"></a>Overview</h2>
While Steam can automatically install many
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/features/common_redist" class="bb_doclink"
    >common redistributables</a
>, your application may have other first-run requirements.
<div class="bb_callout">
    <div>
        NOTE: Install script functionality described below is primarily for Windows operating
        systems. MacOS support is limited to file permissions and symlinks. There is no
        Linux/SteamOS install script functionality at this time.
    </div>
</div>
<br />
An install script file is a configuration file that lets you run certain actions upon
installation.<br />
<br />
Full games/applications and DLC packages may both have install scripts. If you
<a href="#build" class="bb_doclink">integrate your install scripts into your build</a>, you may have
any number of install scripts. For a SteamPlay app, it's recommended that you always use your
OS-specific depots to contain your install scripts.
<h4>Example</h4>
A basic one will look like this:<br />
<div class="bb_code">
    "InstallScript" { "Registry" { "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Foo\\Bar" { "string" {
    "Install_Path" "%INSTALLDIR%" "Exe_Path" "%INSTALLDIR%\\foobar.exe" } "dword" { "PatchVersion"
    "12" } } } "Run Process" { "DirectX" { "HasRunKey"
    "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\Valve\\Steam\\Apps\\480" "Process 1"
    "%INSTALLDIR%\\DirectX\\DXSETUP.exe" "Command 1" "/silent" "NoCleanUp" "1" } } }
</div>
<br />
The second keyname after the root describes what kind of action will take place.<br />
<br />
<strong>Note:</strong> All keynames and values can use escape sequences, so if you use a
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">\</code>, make it a
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">\\</code>.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="build"></a>Integrating Install Scripts into Your Build</h2>
First, the install script file must be part of a depot that is installed with the build. Ensure that
the file resides within the defined ContentRoot of the App or Depot.<br />
<br />
Second, mark an install script using the
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">InstallScript</code> directive in a depot build
script. You can see an example on the
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/sdk/uploading#5" class="bb_doclink"
    >Uploading to Steam - Advanced Build Scripts</a
>
page.<br />
<br />
During the build process, two things take place:<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        The install script is uploaded to Steam and cryptographically signed. This signature is
        validated by Steam before executing any install script, and is required to perform certain
        operations, including writing to the HKLM hive on Windows. This may cause your local copy of
        the install script to be modified.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        The install script is marked in the depot manifest. You can see this in the generated
        <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">manifest.txt</code> file as a
        <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">100</code> in the
        <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">Flags</code> field.
    </li>
</ul>
When a Steam user is starting a game, Steam will scan all of the mounted depots for that game for
any file with the install script flag and run them.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="registry"></a>Registry</h2>
The Registry command allows you to create or modify string and dword registry values. Any key under
the "Registry" keyname will be treated as the full path to the registry key you want to create or
open. Under that key, specify either a "string" or "dword" key. Any keynames and values stored in
the "string" or "dword" keys will be the registry names and values that get set.<br />
To set the
<a
    href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa266441(v=vs.60).aspx"
    target="_blank"
    rel="noreferrer"
    >default value</a
>
for a registry key, you should enter the key name as
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">(Default)</code>.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="run_process"></a>Run Process</h2>
The Run Process command allows your application to run programs before the user first launches your
game.<br />
To determine whether the program needs to run, the install script looks at the keyname (as a
registry DWORD value) in the HasRunKey value. If that value is not present or 0, then it will call
CreateProcess on the processXX/commandXX values. If CreateProcess fails, then ShellExecuteEx is
called. If the program's ExitCode is 0, then the install script assumes it was successful and writes
your keyname as 1 in the registry.<br />
<br />
Steam customers love a quick and silent install. Add silent or quiet parameters to all run process
commands and only add what you absolutely need for the game.<br />
The required Run Process key/values are:<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li><strong>Process 1</strong> - Path to the program you want to launch</li>
</ul>
The optional Run Process key/values are:<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li><strong>Command 1</strong> - Optional command you want to pass to the program.<br /></li>
    <li>
        <strong>HasRunKey</strong> - Optional registry key to check that the prereq is already
        installed.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>NoCleanUp</strong> - Optional flag, when set install script will not delete the
        keyname when your app is deleted from Steam.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>MinimumHasRunValue</strong> - Optional, sets the minimum value the install script
        should check for when determining to launch the program.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Requirement_OS</strong> - Optional key to apply OS requirements. See
        <a href="#requirement_os" class="bb_doclink">OS Specific Requirements</a> for more
        details.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>AsCurrentUser</strong> - Optional flag, set it to 1 if it's important for that
        program to run as the current user. Otherwise, the Steam client might run it as
        Administrator to avoid elevation prompts in Big Picture or VR environments.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="firewall_exceptions"></a>Firewall Exceptions</h2>
If your game uses any networking, use the firewall exception to grant the firewall exception in
windows automatically without forcing the user to accept the exception.<br />
<div class="bb_code">"Firewall" { "Space War Game" "%INSTALLDIR%\\SpaceWar.exe" }</div>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="requirement_os"></a>OS Specific Requirements</h2>
The Requirement_OS value is available to run different installs on different OS versions / SKUs. It
requires a new key group called Requirement_OS, then additional key value pairs inside. Available OS
options are listed below.<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        <strong>Is64BitWindows</strong> - Specifies that the process will only run on a 64 bit
        version of the operating system. Values are 1 or 0.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>OSType</strong> - Specifies that the process will only run on a specific version of
        the operating system. Values are:<br />
        <ul class="bb_ul">
            <li>Windows 3.11<br /></li>
            <li>Windows 95<br /></li>
            <li>Windows 98<br /></li>
            <li>Windows ME<br /></li>
            <li>Windows NT<br /></li>
            <li>Windows 2000<br /></li>
            <li>Windows XP<br /></li>
            <li>Windows 2003<br /></li>
            <li>Windows Vista<br /></li>
            <li>Windows 7<br /></li>
            <li>Windows 2008<br /></li>
            <li>Windows 2012<br /></li>
            <li>Windows 2012 R2<br /></li>
            <li>Windows 8<br /></li>
            <li>Windows 8.1<br /></li>
            <li>Windows 10</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<br />
<strong>64 bit Example</strong><br />
This example will run the appropriate installer for the 32 or 64 bit installer.<br />
<div class="bb_code">
    "Net32" { "Process 1" "%INSTALLDIR%\\redist\\Controller\\32bitInstaller.exe" "NoCleanUp" "1"
    "Requirement_OS" { "Is64BitWindows" "0" } } "Net64" { "Process 1"
    "%INSTALLDIR%\\redist\\Controller\\64bitInstaller.exe" "NoCleanUp" "1" "Requirement_OS" {
    "Is64BitWindows" "1" } }
</div>
<br />
<strong>OS Type Example</strong><br />
This example will only run on Windows XP<br />
<br />
<div class="bb_code">
    "Controller" { "Process 1" "%INSTALLDIR%\\redist\\WinXPInstaller.exe" "NoCleanUp" "1"
    "Requirement_OS" { "OSType" "Windows XP" } }
</div>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="environment_variables"></a>Environment Variables</h2>
Environment variables are supported in an install script. All of the
<a
    href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/shell/csidl"
    target="_blank"
    rel="noreferrer"
    >standard environment variables available on Windows</a
>
can be used, along with a few others specific to an install script. They are:<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        <strong>%INSTALLDIR%</strong> - The full path to where the application is installed, without
        a backslash.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>%ROOTDRIVE%</strong> - The drive letter to where the application is installed, like
        <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">C</code><br />
    </li>
    <li><strong>%APPDATA%</strong> - The \Users\username\AppData\ folder<br /></li>
    <li><strong>%USER_MYDOCS%</strong> - Get the user\My Documents folder<br /></li>
    <li><strong>%COMMON_MYDOCS%</strong> - Get the All Users\Documents folder<br /></li>
    <li>
        <strong>%LOCALAPPDATA%</strong> - \Documents and Settings\username\Local
        Settings\Application Data folder (only on Vista and Newer)<br />
    </li>
    <li><strong>%WinDir%</strong> - Windows installation directory<br /></li>
    <li><strong>%STEAMPATH%</strong> - The full path to the Steam client install directory.</li>
</ul>
<br />
<i
    >Note that these are common paths, but they can be different based on what version of Windows
    the user is running.</i

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="language_specific_values"></a>Language Specific Values</h2>
Both string and DWORD values can be assigned different data depending on what language the user is
running Steam in. To use, create a subkey in the "string" or "dword" key with the name of the
language, then assign the names and values in there. For example:<br />
<div class="bb_code">
    "InstallScript" { "Registry" { "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\MonkeyDime Studios\\Killer Banana
    Peel" { "dword" { "english" { "Language" "1" } "french" { "Language" "2" } "german" { "Language"
    "3" } "italian" { "Language" "4" } "spanish" { "Language" "5" } } } } }
</div>
<br />
The install script gets the language from Steam's registry key, querying the value "Language". If
that value isn't found then "english" is the default.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="uninstallation"></a>Uninstallation of an app</h2>
When a user deletes or verifies your app from Steam, install scripts will be called to remove any
registry values it created. The install script will also remove the value used to determine if a
program should execute from <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">Run Process</code>, so
that it can execute the next time your app runs (unless the
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">NoCleanUp</code> flag is set).
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="runOnUninstall"></a>Run Process on Uninstall</h2>
If you need to run any process at the time your app is uninstalled, add this to the install script.
Please do not uninstall common redists such as DirectX, msvc run time, etc, as they are likely to be
used by other games. This is only intended for game specific uninstall processes.<br />
<br />
<div class="bb_code">
    "InstallScript" { "Run Process On Uninstall" { "Process_name" { "Process 1" "process.exe"
    "Command 1" "/command" } } }
</div>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="FAQ"></a>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<strong
    >Q. Why does my install script keep running my redistributable every time I launch the
    game?</strong
><br />
<strong>A.</strong> This typically means that the redist is returning a non-zero return code. Steam
checks that the return code is zero. If it sees that the return code is zero, it marks the redist as
installed and doesn't run it again. If it returns any other value, Steam will attempt to run it
again on next launch.<br />
<br />
To fix this examine your redistributable paths and parameters. Some redists will return non-zero
values if they already exist on the machine. This can often be fixed by using the redist's silent or
quiet flag.<br />
<br />
<strong>Q. Why doesn't my registry key get written?</strong><br />
<strong>A.</strong> Typically this is because the install script isn't signed and you're writing to
HKLM.<br />
See the section on <a href="#build" class="bb_doclink">build integration</a>, and ensure that a
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">"kvsignatures"</code> key was added to your script
during the build, as Steam requires this signing to be completed to write to HKLM.<br />
<br />
This can also be caused by the Windows 64 bit virtualization on 64 bit Windows, Steam writes to the
<a
    href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms724072(v=vs.85).aspx"
    target="_blank"
    rel="noreferrer"
    >Wow6432Node</a
>
path in the registry.<br />
<br />
<strong>Q. Why doesn't my install script seem to run at all?</strong><br />
<strong>A.</strong> Please double check that your configuration is properly prepared.<br />
<br />
<strong
    >Q. How do I add macOS redistributables? Why doesn't Run Process work in my macOS install
    script?</strong
><br />
<strong>A.</strong> We don't currently have support for installing Mac redistributables. You will
need to put the installer into your main executable.
