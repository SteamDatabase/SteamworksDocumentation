<h1>Creating a retail and &amp;quot;Gold Master&amp;quot; disk</h1>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="Requirements"></a>Before you begin</h2>
Before customizing a Steam gold master disk, first package your game files in one or more depots and
<a href="/doc/sdk/uploading#Building_Retail_Install_Discs">create a retail disc</a>.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="Setup"></a>Customizing the Steamworks Setup Application</h2>
The Steamworks SDK includes a customizable installer that you can include on your gold master. The
installer is designed to help users install Steam and begin loading your game as quickly as
possible. The installer has also been designed to ensure compatibility with the installation portion
of the Games for Windows certification.<br />
To get started, copy all files from the
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">tools\goldmaster\disk_assets</code> folder in the
SDK to your gold master's build output folder (See
<a href="/doc/sdk/uploading#Building_Retail_Install_Discs">building retail discs for Steam Pipe</a
>).
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="setup_config"></a>Configuration</h2>
The setup application can be customized through modifying configuration files and replacing files in
the <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">resources</code> directory. Setup uses two
configuration files: <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">setup.ini</code> (always
loaded) and a localized configuration file (<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight"
    >resources\setup_&lt;language&gt;.ini</code
>).<br />
<br />
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">setup.ini</code> is the first configuration file
loaded by the setup application. This file is used to configure all language independent settings.
The values in this file can be overridden by language specific configuration files. The syntax is
"parameter" "value". The following parameters are available:<br />
<ol>
    <li>
        <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">Game</code> - Game name that appears in the
        setup menu<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">AppID</code> - Application ID for your
        game, provided by Valve<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">URL</code> - URL the user is directed to
        when the technical support button is selected<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">RequiredSize</code> - Amount of disk space
        (in KB) that your game will occupy after installation. If Steam is not installed, this value
        will be used by the Steam's installer to warn the user if they choose to install Steam to a
        drive which does not have enough free disk space to install your game.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">FontName</code> - Font used for menu
        text<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">FontHeight</code> - Height of menu text<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">MenuPos</code> - X and Y coordinates (in
        pixels) for the top left corner of the menu (ex: "200 324")<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">MenuStyle</code> - Alignment of menu text
        (0 = left, 1 = center, 2 = right)<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">ColorDefault</code> - RGB color for menu
        text (ex: "255 255 255")<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">ColorHover</code> - RGB color for menu text
        when the mouse is hovering over the text (ex: "250 180 60")<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">ColorDown</code> - RGB color for menu text
        when a mouse button is depressed over the text (ex: "0 0 0")
    </li>
</ol>
<br />
Setup can also display a EULA before installing your game. The EULA must be an RTF file. Setup will
try to load the EULA from
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">resources\eula_&lt;language&gt;.rtf</code>. If a
localized version is not available, it will try to load
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">resources\eula.rtf</code>. If both files do not
exist, it will skip displaying a EULA.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="localization"></a>Localization</h2>
On startup, the setup application will load each
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">resources\setup_&lt;language&gt;.ini</code>
configuration file. The user will then be asked to select a language from a dropdown listing each
supported language. These localized configuration files can override any value defined in
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">setup.ini</code>, and also define the strings shown
to a user for each language. If you do not support a language for which the SDK supplies a localized
ini file, simply delete the ini file.<br />
If you need to support a language that is currently not supported by Steam, please let us know in
the
<a href="http://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/discussions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
    >Steamworks Development Discussions</a
>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="setup_graphics"></a>Graphics and Sound Effects</h2>
The following files can be replaced to customize the setup application and Steam installation for
your game:<br />
<ol>
    <li>
        <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">splash.tga</code> - Image displayed by
        Steam while installing files from disk (392x165 pixels)<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">icon.ico</code> - Icon used in
        <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">autorun.inf</code> as the icon for your
        installation disk<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">resources\setup.bmp</code> and
        <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">resources\setup_&lt;language&gt;.bmp</code>
        - Image used for the background of setup.exe (640x480 pixels). Setup will first search for a
        localized version, and then load
        <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">setup.bmp</code> if a localized version
        doesn't exist.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">resources\click.wav</code> - Played when a
        button is clicked in setup.exe (delete to play no sound)<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">resources\hover.wav</code> - Played when a
        mouse hovers over a button in setup.exe (delete to play no sound)<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">resources\launch.wav</code> - Played when
        setup.exe starts (delete to play no sound)
    </li>
</ol>
The font name, height, color and other text attributes can be configured through
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">setup.ini</code>. See
<a href="#setup_config">Configuration</a> for more details.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="Testing"></a>Testing</h2>
Once you have built your installation files and customized the setup application, you will have a
gold master image you can use for testing and replication. If your depots have not been uploaded to
the public Steam universe, you will need to test your gold master with a
<a href="/doc/sdk/uploading/local_content_server"
    >Steam client configured to use your local content server</a
>. When testing on a machine with an existing installation of Steam, simply place the
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">steam_dev.cfg</code> which points to your local
content server in the same directory as your Steam installation. When testing on a machine which
does not have Steam installed, you will need to:<br />
<ul>
    <li>Create the directory you plan to install Steam into<br /></li>
    <li>
        Place a copy of the
        <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">steam_dev.cfg</code> that points to your
        local content server in this new directory<br />
    </li>
    <li>Select your new directory when installing Steam through your gold master</li>
</ul>
When you have a final version of your gold master, you should test it on computers WITH and WITHOUT
Steam installed to check both install paths. Steam should show the status of your game as 100% after
the installation is completed.
