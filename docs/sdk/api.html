<h1>Steamworks API Overview</h1>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Overview</h2>
The Steamworks API allows your game to take full advantage of Steam by accessing all of the
underlying systems provided through the API. This includes things such as pausing your game when the
user opens the
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/features/overlay" class="bb_doclink">Steam Overlay</a>,
inviting friends to play, allowing players to unlock
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/features/achievements" class="bb_doclink"
    >Steam Achievements</a
>, letting players compete on the
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/features/leaderboards" class="bb_doclink"
    >Steam Leaderboards</a
>
and much more.<br />
<br />
The
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api" class="bb_doclink">Steamworks API Reference</a>
catalogs and documents every interface, function, callback, and type supported in the API.<br />
<br />
Integration with the Steamworks API is never required to ship your product on Steam, but it is
highly recommended as it allows you to accomplish many interactions that Steam users expect.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="2"></a>Getting Started</h2>
<strong>NOTE:</strong> The Steamworks API officially supports C++, using Microsoft Visual Studio
2008+ on Microsoft Windows, GCC 4.6+ and Clang 3.0+ on macOS and SteamOS / Linux. If you're using a
third party engine or a programming language other than C++ then you should first look at
<a href="#thirdparty" class="bb_doclink">Commercial engine and non-C++ language support</a> to see
if there are more specific instructions to get started with your engine or language of choice. In
some cases you may be able to skip many of these steps.<br />

                your visual studio project. This can be linked to either the primary executable or a
                module that uses Steam. This allows you to access the functionality contained in
                <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">steam_api[64].dll</code> which is
                exposed via the Steamworks API headers. Additional Reading:

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="initialization_and_shutdown"></a>Initialization and Shutdown</h2>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="SteamAPI_Init"></a>SteamAPI_Init</h2>
After you have the Steamworks API set up within your project you can start using it by calling
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/steam_api#SteamAPI_Init" class="bb_apilink"
    >SteamAPI_Init</a
>
function to initialize the API. This will set up the global state and populate the interface
pointers which are accessible via the global functions which match the name of the interface. This
<strong>MUST</strong> be called and return successfully prior to accessing any of the
<a href="#steamworks_interfaces" class="bb_doclink">Steamworks Interfaces</a>!<br />
<br />
The Steamworks API will not initialize if it does not know the App ID of your game. When you launch
your app from Steam itself then it will automatically have the App ID available. While developing
you will need to hint this to Steam with a text file. Create the a text file called
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">steam_appid.txt</code> next to your executable
containing just the App ID and nothing else. This overrides the value that Steam provides. You
should not ship this with your builds. Example:<br />
<div class="bb_code">480</div>
<br />
A return of <strong>false</strong> indicates one of the following conditions:<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        The Steam client isn't running. A running Steam client is required to provide
        implementations of the various Steamworks interfaces.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        The Steam client couldn't determine the App ID of game. If you're running your application
        from the executable or debugger directly then you must have a
        <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">steam_appid.txt</code> in your game
        directory next to the executable, with your app ID in it and nothing else. Steam will look
        for this file in the current working directory. If you are running your executable from a
        different directory you may need to relocate the
        <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">steam_appid.txt</code> file.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Your application is not running under the same OS user context as the Steam client, such as
        a different user or administration access level.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Ensure that you own a license for the App ID on the currently active Steam account. Your
        game must show up in your Steam library.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Your App ID is not completely set up, i.e. in
        <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">Release State: Unavailable</code>, or it's
        missing default packages.
    </li>
</ul>
If you're running into initialization issues then see the
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/sdk/api/debugging" class="bb_doclink"
    >Debugging the Steamworks API</a
>
documentation to learn about the various methods of debugging the Steamworks API.
<h2 class="bb_subsection">
    <a name="SteamAPI_RestartAppIfNecessary"></a>SteamAPI_RestartAppIfNecessary
</h2>
<a
    href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/steam_api#SteamAPI_RestartAppIfNecessary"
    class="bb_apilink"
    >SteamAPI_RestartAppIfNecessary</a
>
checks if your executable was launched through Steam and relaunches it through Steam if it
wasn't.<br />
<br />
This is optional but highly recommended as the Steam context associated with your application
(including your App ID) will not be set up if the user launches the executable directly. If this
occurs then <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">SteamAPI_Init</code> will fail and you
will be unable to use the Steamworks API.<br />
If you choose to use this then it should be the first Steamworks function call you make, right
before
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/steam_api#SteamAPI_Init" class="bb_apilink"
    >SteamAPI_Init</a
>.<br />
<br />
If this returns <strong>true</strong> then it starts the Steam client if required and launches your
game again through it, and you should quit your process as soon as possible. This effectively runs
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline http">steam://run/&lt;AppID&gt;</code> so it may not relaunch
the exact executable that called this function (for example, if you were running from your
debugger). It will always relaunch from the version installed in your Steam library folder.<br />
<br />
Otherwise, if it returns <strong>false</strong>, then your game was launched by the Steam client and
no action needs to be taken. One exception is if a
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">steam_appid.txt</code> file is present then this
will return <strong>false</strong> regardless. This allows you to develop and test without launching
your game through the Steam client. Make sure to remove the
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">steam_appid.txt</code> file when uploading the game
to your Steam depot!<br />
<br />
<strong>NOTE:</strong> If you use the Steam DRM wrapper on your primary executable file, this check
is unnecessary as the DRM wrapper will perform this internally.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="SteamAPI_Shutdown"></a>SteamAPI_Shutdown</h2>
When you are done using the Steamworks API you should call
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/steam_api#SteamAPI_Shutdown" class="bb_apilink"
    >SteamAPI_Shutdown</a
>
to release the resources used by your application internally within Steam. You should call this
during process shutdown if possible.<br />
<br />
This will not unhook the
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/features/overlay" class="bb_doclink">Steam Overlay</a>
from your game as there's no guarantee that your rendering API is done using it.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="steamworks_interfaces"></a>Steamworks Interfaces</h2>
The Steamworks API is composed of multiple interfaces which all expose a limited, specific amount of
functionality.<br />
<br />
After Steamworks has successfully initialized you can then access the interfaces via their global
functions. The functions always match the name of their interface. As such you can access
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamApps" class="bb_apilink">ISteamApps</a>
through the <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">SteamApps()</code> accessor and
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamFriends" class="bb_apilink">ISteamFriends</a>
through <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">SteamFriends()</code>.<br />
<br />
You can use these interfaces to make calls like so:<br />
<div class="bb_code cpp">
    // Get the current users Steam name. const char *name = SteamFriends()-&gt;GetPersonaName();
</div>
<br />
You can view the complete list of interfaces on the
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api" class="bb_doclink">Steamworks API Reference</a> or
by diving into the Steamworks API header files.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="callbacks"></a>Callbacks</h2>
Callbacks are one of the most important aspect of Steamworks, they allow you to retrieve data
asynchronously from Steam without locking up your game. The goal of the callbacks are to provide a
simple, light-weight, type-safe, thread-safe method of raising asynchronous events to any object
registered as a listener.<br />
<br />
Callbacks are usually triggered via an event that happens from Steam such as when ever a friend logs
on or off, or the asynchronous result of some API functions. Each callback consists of a struct
containing a unique identifier and a small set of data. The callbacks are declared in the
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">ISteam*.h</code> header files, grouped with the
interface that it most closely belongs to.<br />
<br />
To listen for a callback, a struct or class must use the macro
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight"
    >STEAM_CALLBACK( :classname, :functionname, :callbackname )</code
>
in it's declaration.<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">:classname</code> must be the name of the
        struct or class where you are defining this. (eg.
        <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">CGameManager</code>)<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">:functionname</code> will be the name of
        the function that receives this callback. (eg.
        <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">OnGameOverlayActivated</code>)<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">:callbackname</code> is the name of the
        callback. (eg.
        <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">GameOverlayActivated_t</code>)
    </li>
</ul>
This defines a local member function for that class which is automatically prototyped as
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight"
    >void :functionname( :callbackname *pCallback )</code
>. Creating a new instance of the object will cause this member function to register itself as a
listener with the Steamworks API; destruction of the object will cause it to de-register.<br />
<br />
<strong>NOTE:</strong> You should ensure that Steam has been initialized before creating objects
that listen for callbacks.<br />
<br />
For callbacks to dispatch to registered listeners you must call the
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/steam_api#SteamAPI_RunCallbacks" class="bb_apilink"
    >SteamAPI_RunCallbacks</a
>. It's best to call this frequently, as the more time between calls, the more latency between
receiving events or results from the Steamworks API. Most games call this once per render-frame,
it's highly recommended that you call this at least once a second. All registered listener functions
will be invoked during this call, in the thread context where
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">SteamAPI_RunCallbacks</code> was called from.
<h4>Example</h4>
One callback that you will likely wish to use is
<a
    href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamFriends#GameOverlayActivated_t"
    class="bb_apilink"
    >ISteamFriends::GameOverlayActivated_t</a
>. As the name implies it sends you a callback every time the user activates or deactivates the
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/features/overlay" class="bb_doclink">Steam Overlay</a
>.<br />
<br />
<div class="bb_code cpp">
    class CGameManager { private: STEAM_CALLBACK( CGameManager, OnGameOverlayActivated,
    GameOverlayActivated_t ); }; void CGameManager::OnGameOverlayActivated( GameOverlayActivated_t*
    pCallback ) { if ( pCallback-&gt;m_bActive ) printf( "Steam overlay now active\n" ); else
    printf( "Steam overlay now inactive\n" ); }
</div>
<br />
One popular and recommended use case for the
<a
    href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamFriends#GameOverlayActivated_t"
    class="bb_apilink"
    >ISteamFriends::GameOverlayActivated_t</a
>
callback is to pause the game when the overlay opens.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="callresults"></a>CallResults</h2>
Many Steamworks methods use call results instead of a callback to asynchronously return results from
a function call. The difference between a callback and call results is that callbacks are broadcast
to all listeners, where-as call results only target a specific listener. Like callbacks, your game
will need to call
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/steam_api#SteamAPI_RunCallbacks" class="bb_apilink"
    >SteamAPI_RunCallbacks</a
>
to dispatch call results to their listener.<br />
<br />
You can identify a function that provides a call result by inspecting it's return value; if it
returns a
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/steam_api#SteamAPICall_t" class="bb_apilink"
    >SteamAPICall_t</a
>
and has a <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">CALL_RESULT()</code> attribute then you
must register to receive the call result. Note that a callback registered to a CCallResult will only
be triggered for the most recent
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/steam_api#SteamAPICall_t" class="bb_apilink"
    >SteamAPICall_t</a
>
set on it, so be aware if you are re-using one.<br />
<br />
<strong>NOTE:</strong> Callbacks and call results are not interchangeable. An event will only come
through one or the other, not both. You must make sure that you are registering for the right type
of event!<br />
<br />
Call results must be created as a member in a struct/class using the CCallResult type and you will
also need to create the member function that will receive the callback.<br />
<div class="bb_code cpp">
    void func( :callresultname *pCallback, bool bIOFailure ); CCallResult&lt; :classname,
    :callresultname &gt; m_callresultname;
</div>
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">:classname</code> must be the name of the
        struct or class where you are defining this. (eg.
        <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">CGameManager</code>)<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">:callresultname</code> is the name of the
        callback. (eg.
        <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">NumberOfCurrentPlayers_t</code>)
    </li>
</ul>
<br />
Feel free to name the function, function parameters, and CCallResult type anything you want.
<h4>Example</h4>
Here's an example of how to use the
<a
    href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamUserStats#GetNumberOfCurrentPlayers"
    class="bb_apilink"
    >ISteamUserStats::GetNumberOfCurrentPlayers</a
>
API which produces a
<a
    href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamUserStats#NumberOfCurrentPlayers_t"
    class="bb_apilink"
    >ISteamUserStats::NumberOfCurrentPlayers_t</a
>
call result.<br />
<div class="bb_code cpp">
    // In your class definition class CGameManager { public: void GetNumberOfCurrentPlayers();
    private: void OnGetNumberOfCurrentPlayers( NumberOfCurrentPlayers_t *pCallback, bool bIOFailure
    ); CCallResult&lt; CGameManager, NumberOfCurrentPlayers_t &gt;
    m_NumberOfCurrentPlayersCallResult; }; // Make the asynchronous request to receive the number of
    current players. void CGameManager::GetNumberOfCurrentPlayers() { printf( "Getting Number of
    Current Players\n" ); SteamAPICall_t hSteamAPICall =
    SteamUserStats()-&gt;GetNumberOfCurrentPlayers(); m_NumberOfCurrentPlayersCallResult.Set(
    hSteamAPICall, this, &amp;CGameManager::OnGetNumberOfCurrentPlayers ); } // Called when
    SteamUserStats()-&gt;GetNumberOfCurrentPlayers() returns asynchronously, after a call to
    SteamAPI_RunCallbacks(). void CGameManager::OnGetNumberOfCurrentPlayers(
    NumberOfCurrentPlayers_t *pCallback, bool bIOFailure ) { if ( bIOFailure ||
    !pCallback-&gt;m_bSuccess ) { printf( "NumberOfCurrentPlayers_t failed!\n" ); return; } printf(
    "Number of players currently playing: %d\n", pCallback-&gt;m_cPlayers ); }
</div>
<br />
<strong>NOTE:</strong> If you can't use the CCallResult system, then you may be able to use
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamUtils#IsAPICallCompleted" class="bb_apilink"
    >ISteamUtils::IsAPICallCompleted</a

    href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamUtils#GetAPICallFailureReason"
    class="bb_apilink"
    >ISteamUtils::GetAPICallFailureReason</a

to track the status of a call result.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="manual_dispatch"></a>Manual Callback Dispatch</h2>
The classes and macros used to register callbacks are convenient in C++ code. But there is also a
lower-level mechanism for dealing with callbacks. This mechanism operates more like a Windows event
loop. Instead of a single function that dispatches all of the callbacks and call results to active
listeners, you fetch the next available callback in a loop, and dispatch it using whatever
mechanisms you want. The manual dispatch mode is especially useful for binding layers that expose
the Steamworks SDK to languages other than C++. See
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">SteamAPI_ManualDispatch_Init()</code> in
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">steam_api.h</code> for more information.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="steam_game_servers"></a>Steam Game Servers</h2>
The Steamworks API includes support for running game servers as well as regular clients. A game
server, in Steamworks API terms, is an entity in the system that normal users connect to to play
multi-player games. This can be connecting over the Internet to a remote game server, or connecting
locally to a game server that's in the same process as the client. Game servers have their own set
of API functions to use, and their own unique Steam ID for other users to refer to them by.<br />
<br />
To use the Steam Game Server API you must first include
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">steam_gameserver.h</code> instead of
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">steam_api.h</code>.<br />
<br />
Initializing and using the game server API is very similar to the normal API:<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">

            >SteamGameServer_ReleaseCurrentThreadMemory</a
        >
    </li>
</ul>
<br />
After initializing a game server you have access to the two game server exclusive interfaces
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamGameServer" class="bb_apilink"
    >ISteamGameServer</a
>
and
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamGameServerStats" class="bb_apilink"
    >ISteamGameServerStats</a
>.<br />
<br />
You can also access the following regular interfaces from the game server:<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamClient" class="bb_apilink"
            >ISteamClient</a
        >
        which you can access via the global interface:
        <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">SteamGameServerClient()</code><br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamUtils" class="bb_apilink"
            >ISteamUtils</a

If you're running a dedicated game server (one which has no client component), you only have to
initialize the game server API's, you don't have to initialize the normal user API.<br />
<br />
See
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/sdk/api/example" class="bb_doclink"
    >Steamworks API Example Application (SpaceWar)</a
>
for a fully loaded example of using the game server API.<br />
<br />
Unlike a game, a dedicated server will usually be run in an environment where there is no Steam
Client installed to provide the latest steamworks binaries. In order for the dedicated server to
have the latest steam binaries, you will need to include the Dedicated Server Redistributables with
your app. Log into
<a href="http://partner.steamgames.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">partner.steamgames.com</a>
and navigate to the technical settings for your app. Then look under "Installation /
Redistributables" and check "Dedicated Server Redistributables"
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="thirdparty"></a>Commercial engine and non-C++ language support</h2>
If you're using a commercial game engine or a language other than C or C++ you will want to see what
level of support for the Steamworks API is provided for it.<br />
In some engines they provide native built-in support, for others you may need a third-party
solution.<br />
<br />
If your engine does not have native support you can use the
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/webapi" class="bb_doclink">Steam Web API</a> to access
many features that Steam supports.<br />
<br />
Regardless of how the Steamworks SDK is implemented in your engine you will need to have the latest
Steamworks SDK to

    >upload your application to Steam</a
>.<br />
<br />
<strong>NOTE:</strong> If some of the software you are shipping on steam is available under a
restrictive open source license then please see

<br />
Here are some common engines that people routinely use to ship games on Steam and the relevant
documentation on how to get started using the Steamworks SDK with them.<br />
<br />
<strong>NOTE:</strong> Valve does not in any way endorse any of these engines or the third-party
solutions. This list is sorted exclusively by name, and is in no way comprehensive, it exists solely
as a starting guide. Engines will only be listed if they include native support or have a
third-party solution that fits the guidelines. Third-party solutions will only be listed if they are
kept reasonably up to date with the Steamworks SDK, are freely available under a permissive license

    <a name="flat_interface"></a>Flat interface for binding to other languages
</h2>
The SDK has a few features to facilitate the creation of binding layers for other languages.<br />
<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">steam_api_flat.h</code> declares a set of
        "flat" functions that mirror the interface functions in the SDK. This is not pure C code,
        but it does use plain C linkage and calling conventions, so it is easy to interop with other
        languages. These functions are exported by
        <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">steam_api[64][.dll/.so/dylib]</code>.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">steam_api.json</code> describes (almost all
        of) the interfaces, types, and functions in the SDK. It is intended that this file be used
        by an automated process to generate binding layer. We hope that this can be used to automate
        95% of the work, but there are still a few special cases that need to be handled manually.
        In particular, CSteamID and CGameID will probably require special handling by your binding
        layer to make it efficient.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="3"></a>Technical Details</h2>
Steam uses a variety of techniques to expose functionality to your application. It's by no means
critical to understand exactly how the Steamworks API works but it's fairly simple and can be useful
in planning out how to code your game with Steam integration in mind.<br />
<br />
When you link to
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">steam_api[64][.dll/.so/dylib]</code> it provides
access to a
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/steam_api" class="bb_doclink"
    >small number of C functions</a
>
which are prefixed with the <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">S_API</code> macro,
these functions are all exposed in
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">steam_api.h</code> and
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">steam_gameserver.h</code>. The
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">steam_api</code> module itself is very small, it
only exposes the base functionality to initialize and shutdown the Steamworks API.<br />
<br />
When the Steamworks API initializes it finds the actively running steam client process and loads
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">steamclient.dll</code> from that path.
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">steamclient.dll</code> is essentially the core
engine of the Steam client. It contains and maintains the information necessary to run Steam. The
Steam client UI uses a similar set of functions as exposed here to access the data provided by
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">steamclient.dll</code>. Since this data is in the
Steam process, all Steam API calls are transparently marshaled and sent via an RPC/IPC mechanism. (A
cross-process pipe,
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamClient#HSteamPipe" class="bb_apilink"
    >ISteamClient::HSteamPipe</a
>).<br />
<br />
The Steam process, via
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">steamclient.dll</code> maintains a constant
connection to the Steam back-end servers. Through this connection all authentication, matchmaking,
friends list and VAC communication occurs. This connection may drop if the user has a network issue,
or if the Steam server they are connected to receives an update. Callbacks will be posted to any
running app if the connection drops or re-establishes. The Steam client will automatically try to
reconnect, and clients running an app receive priority, so the typical reconnect time is under 10
seconds, although in some rare cases may be up to 5 minutes.<br />
<br />
The Steamworks API is versioned through a COM-like mechanism, where a string name and version of an
interface are passed into
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">steamclient.dll</code> which then returns the
correct version of the interface to the caller.
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">steamclient.dll</code> contains a set of adapters
for all released versions of an interface which redirect or re-interpret the old calls in the
context of the latest interface. The adapters live inside the steam client so that they are easy to
update if any issues arise.
