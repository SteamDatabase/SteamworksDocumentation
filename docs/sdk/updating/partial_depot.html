<h1>Partial Depot Update Instructions</h1>
The Steamworks website can be used to create and distribute a new depot version to users that
overrides one or a handful of files that exist in the current depot. This is done using the
<strong>Merge with Default Branch</strong> feature within SteamPipe.<br />
<br />
This is useful when you need to fix a critical bug in your released game and that game is out of
development or you are unable to build a new game depot using the Steamworks SDK.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="1"></a>Performing the Update</h2>
Start by creating a zip file that includes the files you wish to update. When placing files into the
zip, place each file in the same folder hierarchy that matches where it is located inside your
installed game folder. For example, if you are updating a file that is installed to
"bin\engine\thirdparty.dll", place the file under "bin\engine" in your newly created zip file.<br />
<br />
Steam will only update files that are placed within the zip file. These new files will be merged
into the previous depot from the "Default" branch. If your previous depot had 27 files, and only one
file was included in the zip (with the same name and path as one of the previous 27), the new depot
version will still include 27 files that are downloaded to user's machines.<br />
<br />
Once done, follow these steps to upload and deploy the new files:<br />
<ul>
    <li>Login to the Steamworks website<br /></li>
    <li>Select the game you would like to update<br /></li>
    <li>Select <strong>Edit Steamworks Settings</strong><br /></li>
    <li>Select <strong>SteamPipe</strong> &gt; <strong>Web Uploads</strong><br /></li>
    <li>Find the depot you need to update<br /></li>

    <li>Select <strong>Merge With Baseline</strong> from the associated dropdown<br /></li>
    <li>Select <strong>Upload</strong><br /></li>
    <li>
        Once uploaded, you should see a green status message and a new Commit line should appear.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Enter a build note, leave the branch setting at <strong>"None"</strong> and select
        <strong>Commit</strong>.<br />
    </li>
    <li>Select <strong>SteamPipe</strong> &gt; <strong>Builds</strong><br /></li>
    <li>
        Find your new build and set it live on a private test branch with
        <strong>"Preview Changes"</strong><br />
    </li>
    <li>
        After testing your game with these new files, set it live on the
        <strong>"Default"</strong> branch
    </li>
</ul>
