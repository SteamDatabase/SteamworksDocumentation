        <h4>Where do I find the commercial game licenses?</h4>
        Commercial game licenses and special offers can be found on the
        <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/pccafe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
            >PC Café Games page</a
        >
        on Steam. Here you can stay up to date with popular café titles, see what's being played in
        arcades around the world and access available special offers. In order to view and purchase
        the commercial game licenses, you must be logged in with a Steam account that has previously
        signed the PC Café Agreement. Commercial game licenses can then be found by visiting the
        game's individual store page - the license will be displayed right under the regular end
        user purchase option.<br />

        <h4>
            Can I purchase more than one commercial game license at a time and receive a bulk
            discount?
        </h4>
        Commercial accounts will have access on Steam to purchase commercial copies of any game
        where the publisher is offering a commercial copy. During the purchase process you will be
        able to enter the quantity of the commercial game you wish to purchase and any applicable
        volume discounts will be applied at the time of purchase. Bulk discounts are set by the
        publisher of the game directly.<br />

        <h4>Are all games on Steam available through the PC Café Program?</h4>
        No, only games where the publisher/developer has expressly included them in our Café
        program, whether they are available for free or with a charge. It is up to the
        publisher/developer to decide if they want to participate in the program and they are
        responsible for setting the commercial price. <br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Does the Café Program work for schools and universities?</h4>
        Yes. We designed the Café Program to be as flexible as possible. Many universities are using
        the program right now. We understand that some educational environments require limited
        access to specific social features and game content. We have added some school specific
        features such as the ability to hide all games in the Steam library except for those that
        the local server owns a commercial license and other features that closely mimic our Steam
        Family View feature. These features are available in Steamworks and can be turned on by the
        site license admin. <br />

        <h4>Can I refund purchases of commercial game licenses?</h4>
        The refund policy is currently set up to closely mimic the
        <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steam_refunds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
            >consumer version</a
        >
        (2 weeks/2 hours). Site license accounts will be able to purchase commercial packages
        multiple times or in quantity so the 2 weeks/2 hours clock starts ticking at the first
        purchase event. For example, if they purchased L4D and then 3 weeks later purchased another
        copy of L4D, a refund request would be denied because the first copy is more than 2 weeks
        old. If they instead purchased their second copy only 1 week after the first copy, both
        purchases could be refunded provided there was less than 2 combined hours of playtime on the
        licenses.<br />

        <h4>Will my location need to be online all the time?</h4>
        Yes, the PC Café Server and the clients need to be able to communicate with Steam for it to
        manage the licenses and allow users to play. We will not support “offline” mode within the
        program.<br />

        <h4>
            Will the pool of commercial game licenses be usable across all the PCs in my location?
        </h4>
        We will have no limit on the number of PCs that the pool of commercial game licenses can be
        used across so as long they are all on the same network where the authorized Café Server is
        located.<br />

        <h4>How can I add my VAT ID to my license agreement?</h4>
        If your business operates in a country where you need to have your VAT Registration Number
        added to receipts for purchases of commercial content on Steam look for the
        <strong><a href="/pub/view/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Company Details</a></strong>
        option on the Steamworks page. There you will be able to add your number by clicking the
        question mark next to the VAT entry. Note that this option is only available in certain
        countries where it is a requirement.<br />

        <h4>Can commercial game licenses in the license pool be VAC banned?</h4>
        VAC bans will be assigned to the account that was using the game at the time of the
        infraction. VAC bans in your Cafe will result in a commercial license removal. We highly
        recommend that the location owner discourages cheating as a high number of bans associated
        with accounts used in the location may result in removal from the licensing program.<br />
