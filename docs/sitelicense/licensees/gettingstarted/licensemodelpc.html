        <strong>Steam PC Café Server</strong><br />
        <br />
        The Steam PC Café Server allows licensees of the Steam PC Café Program to share commercial
        licenses in their local network. The following instructions will walk you through the setup
        of the Steam PC Café Server. Additional information about the program can be found
        <a href="/pccafe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a>.

<strong>Setup Instructions</strong><br />
<br />
<ul>
    <li>
        Visit the <a href="/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Steamworks website</a> and login with
        your Steam master account credentials. That's the account you signed up with and registered
        as a licensee of the PC Café Program.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Download the Steam PC Café Server file by clicking the link located under the "Tools +
        Links" section on the right. Unzip the server files to your hard drive.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Create a new Steam account
        <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/about/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a>
        that will be used at the individual location as a server account. If you have multiple
        physical locations, you will need one Steam Server account per location.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Once the account has been created, go back to the Steamworks website (make sure you're
        logged in with your Steam master account), navigate to the "Users &amp; Permissions" menu
        option and select "Manage Users". On this page click the "Add User" button and fill in the
        required information about the Steam server account you've just created. Don't give it any
        special permissions.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Go to the "Manage Sites" page and add a new Café location. The name you select here will
        also be displayed in the Steam client library of your patrons. Once the new location has
        been added, move the mouse cursor over the new location entry. You should see a key symbol
        appear under the "Server Account" section. Click on the key and select the Steam server
        account you just added. Repeat this step if you have multiple locations. <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Important:</strong> Ensure that the "Country" you select for your site location
        matches the actual country that your site server will operate in. We may reject Café Server
        logins from IP addresses that don't map to a matching country or region.<br />
        <br />
        Once you have completed the above setup, it’s time to run the server in your local
        network.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Navigate to the folder that the server files have been extracted to and double click
        steamcmd.exe, enter the Steam account credentials of your Steam Server account for the
        location. You can double check what account has been assigned to the location
        <a href="/sitelicense/editsites/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a> by logging in
        with your master account.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        The first time you're launching the server on a new machine, you will need to enter the
        Steam Guard code that will be sent to the email address associated with the Steam Server
        account.
    </li>
</ul>

    <div>
        <strong>Content Cache</strong><br />
        <br />
        The content cache allows you to download game files once and then distribute them through
        your local network to the individual game stations. Patrons that bring their own computer or
        laptop can also access the game files instead of using your location's Internet bandwidth.
        Please note that the game files will be saved on your server machine and you may need to
        increase your hard drive space depending on the amount of games that you will offer.
    </div>
</div>
<br />
<strong>Configuration</strong><br />
<br />
To enable the content cache or make any changes, go to "Settings" and select "Content Cache" from
the drop down menu.<br />
<br />

    alt="settings.png"
    title="settings.png"
/><br />
<br />
When a game is launched for the first time in your network, the download request will be sent to the
server machine. If the game files are not cached on the server yet, the server will download them
automatically, cache them, and return them to the client machine. If the game content cache is
already available on your server, the server will automatically send the files to the client
machine.<br />

    <div><h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3></div>

<br />
<ul>
    <li>
        <i
            >Are there any special requirements for the type of hardware I use for the Steam PC Café
            Server?</i
        ><br />
        <br />
        To run a Steam PC Café Server, you just need a secure Windows 7 or Windows 10 PC connected
        to the location's network. You will also be able to run it on Windows Server 2012 R2 and
        2016. If you are also using the PC Café Server as a content server cache we recommend that
        it has enough storage to support 1TB of content data.<br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <i>Do the client machines have to be on the same network as the Steam PC Café Server?</i
        ><br />
        <br />
        Yes, the feature will only be properly functioning if server and stations are on the same
        subnet. Packets are not forwarded to other subnets and only client machines that are in the
        same network will have access to the license pool and content cache feature.<br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <i>Provider authentication FAILED: This account is not associated with any sites</i><br />
        <br />
        This error usually indicates that the account used to run the PC Café Server has not been
        added to the site location on the Steamworks partner page yet. Please navigate to Steamworks
        and make sure you log in with your master account. You can double check the account
        credentials under the "Sites" option at the top or by clicking
        <a href="/sitelicense/editsites/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a>. If no server
        account has been assigned yet, a server account must be added to the license agreement
        first, by clicking the "Manage Users" option on the Steamworks page. Once added, you will be
        able to assign it to a site location. A server account is basically a Steam account that
        does not own anything.<br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <i>What ports are being used by the Steam PC Café Server?</i><br />
        <br />
        The Steam PC Café Server uses UDP broadcast packets over port 27036 to announce itself to
        Steam clients on the network. The client machine must be able to receive those packets to
        know about the PC Café Server. Then, the Steam client will connect to the server using a TCP
        connection on port 27037. The server machine must allow TCP connections on that port. For a
        full list of other required ports and protocols for Steam see
        <a

    <li>
        <i>Can I turn off the auto logout feature in my network?</i><br />
        <br />
        The Steam PC Café Server will make sure that inactive Steam accounts will be logged off
        automatically after a certain time has passed. We strongly recommend that you do not turn
        off this feature, as it is very valuable for customers that have left the PC without logging
        out of their Steam account. If you do choose to deactivate this feature, we recommend that
        you let your customers know. To deactivate the feature, you will need to navigate to the
        server file location and open <i>steamconsole.cfg</i> with a text editor. Adding the
        following command line will deactivate the auto log off within your network, when the server
        is active: <strong>@bSiteLicenseAllowCachedClientCredentials 1</strong>
