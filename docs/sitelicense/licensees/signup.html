<h1>PC Café Requirements &amp;amp; Sign Up Instructions</h1>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Onboarding</h2>
<br />As part of the Steamworks onboarding process, you will be required to
complete the following steps:<br /><br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
  <li>Provide information about your organization.<br /></li>
  <li>
    Electronically sign the Non Disclosure Agreement and the PC Café Agreement.
    The NDA is required to access the Steamworks partner portal.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="2"></a>Company Identification</h2>
<br />When entering your company information, you must follow these
guidelines:<br /><br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
  <li>
    Enter your legal first and last name. Do not enter an alias or nickname.<br />
  </li>
  <li>
    The Company Legal Name must be the legal entity that will be signing the PC
    Café Agreement.<br />
  </li>
  <li>
    The company name you enter must match the name as written on official
    documents with your bank and on United States IRS tax documents or foreign
    tax documents, if applicable.<br />
  </li>
  <li>
    You should not enter a Doing Business As ("DBA") or "friendly name" or
    alias/nickname for your company name.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="3"></a>Company Types</h2>
<br />You will need to provide both the legal company name and company form to
onboard to Steamworks. An example of a Company Form is "A Quebec limited
liability partnership" or "A Washington State corporation" or "A Sole
Proprietorship". If you own the organization as an individual, indicate "Sole
Proprietorship" and enter your legal first and last name as the Company Name. Do
not enter a "Doing Business As" (d/b/a) or "friendly name."<br /><br />Note:
While we can work with non-US corporations and non-US sole proprietorships, we
are unable to work with partnerships that exist outside the US, if such a
partnership is taxed at the individual partner(s) versus the partnership level.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="4"></a>Prerequisites</h2>
<br />In order to sign up for the PC Café Program, you will need to have either
a new Steam account or an account that has not purchased or activated any Steam
products. This is the account that you will use for signing digital paperwork
and for configuring and managing your site(s). This will be referred to as your
Master Account. Please note that once the account was turned into a Café
account, it will no longer be able to purchase any regular end user games and
can only be used as a commercial account to manage your location(s) and have the
option to purchase commercial game licenses.<br /><br />To create a new Steam
account, please visit the
