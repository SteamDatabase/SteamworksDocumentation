            <h3><strong>Recommended Setup</strong></h3>

                        >PC Cafés - Patrons log in with their personal Steam account for the full
                        Steam experience</u
                    ></strong
                ><br />
                <br />
                This setup lets users experience Steam at your location in exactly the same way as
                they would at home. They can earn achievements, rewards, game saves, item drops and
                even buy things in game.<br />
                <br />
                This model will require you to run a Steam PC Café Server on a secure computer at
                your location(s). <br />
                <br />
                Commercial game licenses are purchased with one Steam (master) account and added to
                a game license pool. <br />
                <br />
                Patrons of your venue will be able to log in with their personal Steam account, view
                the game licenses that you offer through their Steam library and have the option to
                "check them out" temporarily while in your establishment. They can also play the
                games they already own on their personal Steam account; this will not affect the
                game licenses in your license pool.<br />
                <br />
                You and your customers will benefit from the following:<br />
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Easy game management using a shared pool of licenses all purchased with your
                        Steam master account.<br />
                    </li>
                    <li>Commercial license discounts and bulk purchase option.<br /></li>
                    <li>
                        If you have multiple locations these licenses can be shared across all of
                        your locations.<br />
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The PC Café Server can also act as a local content cache to minimize
                        Internet bandwidth usage.<br />
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Gather and view usage stats on how your customers are using Steam in your
                        business.

                <u><strong>VR Arcades Only - Dedicated Steam Account per VR station</strong></u
                ><br />
                This model allows VR arcades to create a dedicated Steam account for each station.
                This will allow patrons to simply walk up to the VR station and dive into Virtual
                Reality without having to log in or create a Steam account. <br />
                <br />
                The downside is the extra management required for each account as they must each own
                their own set of commercial games that the owner purchases individually. Also, since
                users aren't logged in with their own personal Steam account, they will only have
                access to the commercial game licenses on your dedicated accounts and won't be able
                to keep achievements or in-game items. <br />
                <br />
                Since commercial game licenses are purchased with the individual station account,
                you will also not have access to the Café server features and content cache.<br />
                <br />
                <i>VR Arcades may also refer to the recommended setup model.</i>
