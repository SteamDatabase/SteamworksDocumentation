<h1>Publishers</h1>
The <strong>Steam PC Café Program</strong> provides a secure and efficient way for third party
organizations to run Steam in public venues around the world. We’d like to invite you to offer your
title(s) to the licensees of this program.<br /><br />In addition to opening the ability to
<strong>more game sales</strong>, offering access to your games through commercial sites like Cafés
can be a great way to <strong>expand the visibility of your games</strong>,
<strong>drive up player numbers</strong>, and <strong>build word of mouth</strong> on your
titles.<br /><br />Cafés and public gaming spaces are inherently populated with core consumers and
influencers. They provide an opportunity for users to see and play games they may not otherwise get
a chance to play. This is especially true in territories such as Korea, Taiwan, SE Asia, Turkey,
China and in new markets like LATAM and India, where playing games is primarily done in public
spaces such as Cafés.<br /><br />Commercial sites can be any location that provides access to the
Internet, which includes but is not limited to Cybercafés, PC Bangs, retail shops, coffee shops,
schools, libraries, hospitals, theaters, airplanes, buses, trains, subways, etc. You can find
additional information about licensee requirements

        <br /><strong>Commercial License Creation</strong><br /><br />You can create your own
        commercial license package through the Steamworks partner site by navigating to your titles
        landing page and selecting "Create Commercial Package" under the "Store Presence" tab.<br /><br /><img
            src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/commercial-package.jpg"
            alt="commercial-package.jpg"
            title="commercial-package.jpg"
        /><br /><br />Next, you will need to submit pricing by selecting the commercial package. We
        recommend offering the commercial license at the same price as the regular end user version.
        <br /><br /><img
            src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/cafe_commercial_packages.JPG"
            alt="cafe_commercial_packages.JPG"
            title="cafe_commercial_packages.JPG"
        /><br /><br />Prices will then get approved by Valve.<br /><br /><img
            src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/cafe_priced_waitingapproval.jpg"
            alt="waiting for approval"
            title="waiting for approval"
        /><br /><br />As soon as the prices are approved, you will be able to publish the license by
        selecting "Release" next to the commercial license package. <br /><br /><img
            src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/cafe_ready_for_release.jpg"
            alt="ready for release"
            title="ready for release"
        /><br /><br />Your game's commercial license will now be displayed right under the regular
        end user purchase option and will only be visible to licensees of the Steam PC Café
        Program.<br /><br /><img
            src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/commercial_license_HL.jpg"

        /><br /><br /><br /><strong>Special Content for Commercial Packages</strong
        ><br /><br />Steam allows publishers and developers to add special features or additional
        content just for Cafés by making a new package and defining the content to be included in
        the package. We encourage developers to consider this as a way to tailor their game for use
        in a Café. The commercial version should, at a minimum, include the same game content as the
        regular end user version. <br />

<ul class="bb_ul %1$s">
    <li>
        <h4>How does the license management work in a Café?</h4>
        Licensees will be able to purchase commercial game licenses in bulk with one (master)
        account through the commercial section in the Steam store. (Floating) commercial licenses
        can be used on any PC that is permanently or temporarily connected to the Café’s network.
        <br /><br />For example, a site can have 20 PCs and only 10 commercial licenses for a game.
        The first 10 PCs to use the content are provided access, the rest are denied until the
        licensee adds additional game licenses or usage of the original 10 free up. The program will
        support the concurrent licensing model across all locations identified under the same
        business entity. If one of these organizations operates from multiple locations (sites),
        they can identify each site during the registration process and share all licensed Steam
        content across all the sites. Steam handles the management of that content through a local
        site server at each location.<br /><br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Is it safe from piracy?</h4>
        The Steam PC Café Program safely manages games through a concurrent seat format that is
        meant to discourage traditional piracy found around the world where Cafés are trying to
        minimize the cost of licensing every Café seat. This program requires the Cafés to be online
        all the time to have access to the legitimate commercial licenses they subscribed to.<br /><br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>
            Can visitors of a Café purchase in-game content and DLC while using the commercial game
            license?
        </h4>
        Yes! Users will be logging in with their own Steam account in the Cafés and can purchase
        content or in-game items with their Steam account while using the Café's commercial license.
        It can be considered as a smaller investment into your game before they purchase the whole
        game with their own account.<br /><br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Can Café visitors use their personal copy of a game?</h4>
        Yes. Besides using the commercial game licenses from the location's license pool, visitors
        can also play all of their regular games they own with their personal Steam account.
        Customers that bring in their laptop, and are allowed to join the network running the PC
        Café Server, will also be able to access the games in the license pool.<br /><br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Is the Café required to purchase commercial copies of the games?</h4>
        No, agreeing to the PC Café license provides the individual or business with a license to
        use Steam, SteamVR and any commercially licensed content that is available for free on
        Steam. <br /><br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Can I provide Steam Keys to Cafés?</h4>
        Only commercially licensed keys will be compatible with the Café program. If you want to
        provide commercial keys to Cafés, schools or libraries, please reach out to us directly. For
        general information around Steam keys, refer to the information
        <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/features/keys" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
            >here</a
        >. Please do not provide regular retail/alpha keys to commercially licensed Cafés, as this
        will not cover them with the necessary agreement and they may run into issues in the
        future.<br /><br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Can a commercial license be VAC banned?</h4>
        No, VAC bans will be assigned to the customer's Steam account that was using the game at the
        time of the infraction. We also recommend location owners to discourage cheating in their
        establishments, as a high number of bans associated with accounts used in the location may
        result in removal from the PC Café Program.<br /><br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>If I want to see other samples of commercial licenses where do I go?</h4>
        Check out our PC Café content hub
        <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/pccafe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a
        >.<br />You can also tick the "Commercial License" option under "Show selected types" when
        using the filter to search the Steam store. On the game's store page, the commercial license
        price will be displayed right under the regular purchase option.<br /><br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Are commercial licenses refundable?</h4>
        The
        <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steam_refunds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
            >refund policy</a
        >
        is set up to closely mimic the consumer version (2 weeks/2 hours).<br /><br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Can I see if a player is in a Café?</h4>
        You can make use of our webAPI ownership calls to find out if the player is borrowing a
        license from the Café they're in and provide them with special items or content. Please
        refer to our API documentation

            >here</a
        >.<br /><br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Can I offer a different version of the app to commercial licensees?</h4>
        Yes! You may add a special version of your app to commercial licenses. You can add a
        separate
        <a
            href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/application/depots"

            rel="noreferrer"
            >Depot</a
        >
        and then specify it via the commercial license package. Owners of the commercial license
        will automatically download the differing content that has been assigned to the package.
        This allows partners to add game modes, scoring features or even unlock content to those
        customers - if it makes sense in a Café or arcade environment.<br /><br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Where do I find my commercial sales data?</h4>
        Your Steam Sales Report is available on the secure partner site under the "Reports" tab.
        Commercial license sales data will be listed separately once they occur.<br /><br />
