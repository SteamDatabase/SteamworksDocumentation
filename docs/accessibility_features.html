<h1>Accessibility Features</h1>
Steam now supports the display of accessibility features for games making it easier for players to
find games they want to play that meet their needs and interests. Developers can now indicate which
accessibility features they support, and these will be displayed on the Steam store page for those
games. Additionally, players can specifically search for games that support these features.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Store Page Display</h2>
The Accessibility options that the developer indicates are available for their game are displayed on
the side of the store page. By default, it's collapsed:<br />

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="gameplay_recommendations"></a>Gameplay</h2>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="adjustable_difficulty"></a>Adjustable Difficulty</h2>
<h4>Why is this tag important to players?</h4>
Difficulty settings allow players to match their experience to their abilities and preferences. For
example, difficulty designed to be engaging for a player with full mobility might be frustrating for
a player with limited mobility. Players can look for this tag to know they can adjust their
experience accordingly.
<h4>Recommendations</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        If possible, provide granular controls over difficulty settings. For example, an FPS might
        allow adjusting enemy health, aim assist, one-hit kills, or invulnerability.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        When providing preset difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard, etc.) explain the difference
        between the levels.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="saving_options"></a>Save Anytime</h2>
<h4>Why is this tag important to players?</h4>
Players may need to be able to safely stop playing at any time. Players can look for this tag to
know that they won't lose significant progress if interrupted.
<h4>Recommendations</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        Let players save at any time, except during loading, or if loading the save would cause
        game-breaking scenarios.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Allow both manual saving and auto-saving, and use separate save slots for both types of
        saves. Don't have auto-saves overwrite manual saves.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="audio_recommendations"></a>Audio</h2>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="volume_controls"></a>Custom Volume Controls</h2>
<h4>Why is this tag important to players?</h4>
Players may need to reduce distracting sounds so that they can focus on sounds that they need to
hear. Players can look for this tag to know that they can adjust the relative levels of different
types of sound in the game.
<h4>Recommendations</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        Provide separate volume controls for music, sound effects, ambient audio, and character
        speech.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        The more distinct volume controls you can provide, the better. For example, consider
        separate sliders for active sound effects (those critical to gameplay like footsteps or
        gunshots) and background sound effects (like traffic noise or background speech).
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="narrated_menus"></a>Narrated Game Menus</h2>
<h4>Why is this tag important to players?</h4>
Players with low vision may rely on narration to interact with menus. Players can look for this tag
to know that they can understand and use game menus without seeing the text.
<h4>Recommendations</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        Either expose your UI tree to screen readers (for example, through
        <a
            href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winauto/entry-uiauto-win32"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noreferrer"
            >Microsoft UI Automation</a
        >) or provide narration for all game menus and notifications.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Narrate headings and subheadings, provide alt text for non-decorative images, and narrate
        the name, role and state of interactive elements (for example "Volume, slider, 60%")<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Whenever context changes, such as switching between screens, narrate the new context. This
        includes user-initiated changes such as switching tabs, and game-initiated changes like
        leaving a loading screen.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Allow users to enable narration as soon as possible when launching the game for the first
        time, or start with it enabled and allow users to disable it.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="stereo_sound"></a>Stereo Sound</h2>
<h4>Why is this tag important to players?</h4>
Players can look for this tag to know that they can tell whether sounds came from the left or right
of the player.
<h4>Recommendations</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        For sounds that have an in-game location, adjust the left and right channels to indicate
        their relative position to the player.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        For critical gameplay sounds, consider also providing an option for a visual indicator as to
        the direction the sound came from.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="surround_sound"></a>Surround Sound</h2>
<h4>Why is this tag important to players?</h4>
Players can look for this tag to know that they can tell what direction a sound came from, in any
direction including above, below, behind and ahead.
<h4>Recommendations</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        For sounds that have an in-game location, output spatial audio channels to indicate their
        relative position to the player.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        For critical gameplay sounds, consider also providing an option for a visual indicator as to
        the direction the sound came from.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="visual_recommendations"></a>Visual</h2>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="adjustable_text_size"></a>Adjustable Text Size</h2>
<h4>Why is this tag important to players?</h4>
Increasing text size is useful both for players with low vision and players playing on a larger or
further-away screen. Players can look for this tag to know that they can adjust the size of menu and
HUD text so that they can read it clearly.
<h4>Recommendations</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Either provide a large default text size, or allow users to increase it.<br /></li>
    <li>Allow scaling text up to at least 38 pixels tall at 1080p or 76 pixels tall at 4k.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="subtitles"></a>Subtitle Options</h2>
<h4>Why is this tag important to players?</h4>
Basic subtitle support can be insufficient for players with impaired vision. Providing options for
background opacity, text color and size can allow players to customize the subtitles for their
comfort. Players can look for this tag to know that they can enable clear, readable subtitles for
all dialog.
<h4>Recommendations</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Identify who is speaking in subtitles.<br /></li>
    <li>Avoid intersecting HUD elements with subtitles, either behind or over.<br /></li>
    <li>Use a readable sans-serif font.<br /></li>
    <li>Provide the option for a background container, with adjustable opacity.<br /></li>
    <li>Provide options for scaling the size of subtitle text, separately from UI text.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="color_alternatives"></a>Color Alternatives</h2>
<h4>Why is this tag important to players?</h4>
Not all players see color the same way, and colors cannot always be relied upon to communicate
gameplay features. Players can look for this tag to know that they will not be required to use color
to distinguish between gameplay elements, or that they can change which colors are used.
<h4>Recommendations</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        Avoid using color as the only way to differentiate important information. Provide other
        ways, such as shape, patterns, icons or text.<br />
    </li>
    <li>If color is unavoidable, provide options for changing the colors used.<br /></li>
    <li>
        Don't rely on full-screen filters. If you provide preset modes for e.g. red/green
        colorblindness, also provide the ability to pick specific colors for each element.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="camera_comfort"></a>Camera Comfort</h2>
<h4>Why is this tag important to players?</h4>
Camera effects such as screen shake, motion blur and camera bob can cause discomfort or harm to some
players. Players can look for this tag to know that they will be able to adjust or disable these
effects.
<h4>Recommendations</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        If your game has player-controlled camera movement, allow players to adjust the speed of
        that movement.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        The following effects are examples of things that can cause discomfort:<br />
        <ul>
            <li>Screen shake<br /></li>
            <li>Motion blur<br /></li>
            <li>Camera bob/sway<br /></li>
            <li>
                Taking control of the camera away, e.g. automatically pointing the camera at a point
                of interest
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Allow players to adjust the intensity of these effects or disable them entirely</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="input_recommendations"></a>Input</h2>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="keyboard_only"></a>Keyboard Only Option</h2>
<h4>Why is this tag important to players?</h4>
Players might prefer to use only a keyboard, or are using accessibility tools that map to keyboard
inputs. Players can look for this tag to know that they can play the game using only keyboard
inputs.
<h4>Recommendations</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Support binding all actions to keyboard inputs, including camera movements.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="mouse_only"></a>Mouse Only Option</h2>

<ul>
    <li>
        Provide ways to interact with the game using only the mouse, such as on-screen controls, or
        movement based on clicking.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="touch_only"></a>Touch Only Option</h2>
<h4>Why is this tag important to players?</h4>
Players might prefer to use only touch inputs, such as a touchpad or touchscreen. Players can look
for this tag to know that they can play the game using only touch inputs.
<h4>Recommendations</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        Provide ways to interact with the game using only touch inputs, such as on-screen controls,
        or movement based on touch.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="without_qte"></a>Playable without Timed Inputs</h2>
<h4>Why is this tag important to players?</h4>
Quick time events, which require a sequence of precisely-timed button presses or button mashing, can
be uncomfortable or impossible for players. Players can look for this tag to know that they can play
without being required to perform these actions.
<h4>Recommendations</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        Give players a way to avoid needing to perform quick time events, such as an option to
        disable them, or avoid using them entirely.<br />
    </li>
    <li>If button mashing is required for an input, give an option to hold the input instead.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="tts"></a>Text-to-speech</h2>
<h4>Why is this tag important to players?</h4>
Social experiences such as text chat in a game can be unavailable for players with low vision.
Players can look for this tag to know that they can have text chat narrated for them.

</ul>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="stt"></a>Speech-to-text communications</h2>
<h4>Why is this tag important to players?</h4>
Social experiences such as voice chat in a game can be unavailable for players with hearing
impairment. Players can look for this tag to know that they can have voice chat transcribed to text
for them.
<h4>Recommendations</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Provide options for transcribing all player-to-player voice chat in real-time.<br /></li>
    <li>
        Show transcribed voice chat in the same on-screen location as text chat so that they can be
        read together.
    </li>
</ul>
