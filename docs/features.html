<h1>Features</h1>
Steamworks offers a large collection of tools that can help you add value to your product. These
include things like Matchmaking, Achievements, and Steam Workshop (User-Generated Content). You are
free to use as few or as many as you like - not all features of Steamworks are appropriate for all
products.<br />
<br />
Some features like Trading Cards can be set up entirely in the Steamworks portal, while others will
need to be implemented in your product. See the <a href="/doc/api">Steamworks API Reference</a> or
<a href="/doc/webapi">Steamworks Web API Reference</a> for more technical information.<br />
<br />
This section gives an overview of the Steamworks features and where applicable includes
presentations or tutorials about a particular topic.<br />

                Steam started as a multiplayer gaming platform with the release of Counter-Strike

                features and APIs to improve the multiplayer experience for developers and customers
                alike. With these features you can easily allow players to find and play with each
                other using the Steam Matchmaking APIs, or use the Steam Game Servers API to provide
                persistent dedicated servers that your players can create communities around.

                capabilities of our rich presence system to show more about the games being played.
                We see a player's rich presence as a way to engage the player's friends in their
                activity. For example, friends who own the game engage by knowing the right time to
                join the game or by talking about it with the player, and those who don't own the
                game may have their interest piqued by coming across a variety of rich presence
                strings that tell them more about a game that they don't know much about.
