<h1>Steamworks Virtual Conference Resources</h1>
Here is a directory of additional resources and examples from the Steamworks Virtual Conference.<br />
<br />
In the course of putting together our talk "Hands-on with Steam's Communication Tools," we sifted
through hundreds of posts from games big and small across Steam looking for a variety of examples to
point to. We couldn't include them all in our talk, but we thought that many of these might serve as
useful inspiration for you as you are considering your own events and announcements.
