<h1>Onboarding</h1>
As part of the Steamworks onboarding process, you will be required to complete the following steps.
This is so Valve can pay you correctly and accurately, and verify your identity. You will also need
to electronically sign the Non Disclosure Agreement and the Steam Distribution Agreement.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="1"></a>What to Expect</h2>
There are a couple of steps along the path to getting your game up and ready for distribution via
Steam. Here is a general overview.<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>Sign the digital paperwork. You’ll need the information as detailed below.<br /></li>
    <li>
        Pay the app deposit fee with any supported Steam payment method as detailed below.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Complete the paperwork with your bank and tax information as well as identity verification
        so that we know who we’ll be doing business with.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Now you have access to Steamworks and can begin preparing your title for release. You’ll
        need to build your store page, upload your builds, configure any Steamworks features, and
        enter your desired pricing. We’ve worked hard to streamline our tools and document all the
        features and functionality available to you. Check out the Steamworks documentation for more
        details.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Before your store page or game build can go live, there is a brief review process where we
        run your game, look at your store page, and check that it is configured correctly and
        running as expected and not doing anything harmful. This takes between 1-5 days.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        There are a couple of additional timing requirements before you can release your first few
        titles on Steam:<br />
        <ul class="bb_ul">
            <li>
                A 30-day waiting period between when you paid the app fee and when you can release
                your game. This gives us time to review your information and confirm that we know
                who we're doing business with.<br />
            </li>
            <li>
                You’ll need to prepare your store page and put up a publicly-visible ‘coming soon’
                page for at least two weeks. This will help you start building your audience of
                interested customers that can wishlist your game or participate in discussions. This
                also gives you the opportunity to practice how you talk about your product so that
                you can have the best presentation when you hit the ‘release’ button.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Now you’re all set to release. The release controls are now in your hands and you can update
        whenever you want.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="2"></a>Information you should have handy</h2>
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        <strong>Company Identification</strong><br />
        We'll need accurate, legal identification of the entity signing so we know who you are and
        who you represent.<br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Payment information</strong><br />
        We'll need accurate bank information, such as routing number, bank account number, and bank
        address so we know where to send payments from sales of your application.
        <div class="bb_callout">
            <div>
                <strong>Note</strong>: The account holder name on your bank account must match the
                name you provide when onboarding. If you don't yet have a bank account established
                for your business, you will need to open one before you can proceed. It's OK to
                onboard as an individual, but your bank account will need to be under the same name
                you provided for Legal Company Name.

        <br />

    <li>
        <strong>Tax information</strong><br />
        You’ll be directed through a brief tax questionnaire to determine your tax status and
        withholding rate. The information you need in order to complete the questionnaire will
        depend on whether you are signing up as an individual or as a company, and where you or your
        company is located. US citizens and corporations will need information similar to that found
        on
        <a href="http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fw9.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
            >form W-9</a

                <strong>Note:</strong> Once you submit your tax information, it is verified with a
                third party service. This process may take 2-7 business days, and you may be asked
                to provide additional documentation. Please keep an eye out for emails requesting
                additional documents. You cannot make changes to your tax information until this
                process has been completed.

    <li>
        <strong>Product Submission Fee</strong><br />
        In order to get fully set up, you will need to pay a $100 USD (or equivalent) fee for each
        product you wish to distribute on Steam. You can pay this fee with any payment method
        supported by Steam in your region.<br />
