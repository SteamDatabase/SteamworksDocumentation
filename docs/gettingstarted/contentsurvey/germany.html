<h1>Age Ratings Mandatory in Germany</h1>
German regulators have specified that all games must have an age rating in order to be offered to
German customers on Steam.
<div class="bb_callout">
    <div>
        Starting on <strong>November 15, 2024, </strong>Steam will no longer display games to
        customers in Germany if the game is missing a valid age rating.
    </div>
</div>
<br />
Such age ratings can come from two sources: <br />
<br />
A game can have a rating issued by German self-rating body
<a href="https://www.usk.de" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">USK</a> or it can have one issued by
Valve through its own self-rating process. Valve's process takes into account customer feedback,
input from Valve's content review teams and the content survey that the developer has filled in for
the game.<br />
<br />
<u
    >Your game cannot receive a content review rating from Valve if you have not filled in the
    game's content survey.</u
><br />
<br />
Therefore, to ensure that a game is available for sale in Germany, you need to truthfully complete
Steam's built-in content questionnaire and submit the results.

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="2"></a>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<strong>Q. When do I need to complete this questionnaire by?</strong><br />
A. You can complete the questionnaire at any time. Games without a German age rating will be hidden
from customers in Germany starting November 15, 2024.<br />
<br />
To ensure that we can resolve any questions that may arise from the information we receive as part
of your questionnaire without your game going offline in Germany, we recommend that you submit your
questionnaire in advance of this deadline.<br />
<br />
<strong
    >Q. If I fill out the questionnaire, is my game guaranteed to remain available in
    Germany?</strong
><br />
A. No. There are certain kinds of content that are not allowed for sale to customers in Germany. If
present in your game, this content must be disclosed in the content questionnaire. Please complete
the questionnaire completely and truthfully.<br />
<br />
Unless we have conflicting information from our content review teams or community feedback, Steam
will issue an appropriate rating for your game in Germany as soon as you have submitted the
questionnaire. If the generated rating allows, your game will automatically become / stay visible to
customers in Germany.<br />
<br />
<strong>Q. What if my game has a USK rating?</strong><br />
A. If your game has been issued an age rating by going through the rating process directly with USK,
you may also enter that information within the store page editor for your game. This is rare. If
your game was not actually reviewed by the team at USK, do not enter a USK rating. Also, if there
was a manual review by USK but the reviewed version was not the exact one you distribute on Steam,
do not enter a USK rating.<br />
<br />
In particular, you must not submit a USK rating on Steam if it has been generated through the IARC
process on a third-party store.<br />
<br />
If you are unsure whether your game has a USK rating, please check on their

    >official website</a
>.<br />
<br />
<strong>Q. Will this affect customers who already own a license to my game? </strong><br />
A. No. If your game does not have an age rating this will affect the visibility of your game on the
German Steam storefront but German customers who already own a license will be able to continue to
access and play it without restrictions. <br />
