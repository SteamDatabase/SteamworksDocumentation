<h1>Steam Direct Fee</h1>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Overview</h2>
Whether you are completing the Steam Direct signup process or are already an established Steamworks
developer, you can now simply pay a $100 USD (or equivalent) fee for each new app you wish to
distribute on Steam. Read below for details on how it works.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="2"></a>Onboard On Steamworks</h2>
When you are signing up as a Steamworks developer for the first time, you'll need to complete a set
of digital paperwork. One of the steps in that paperwork is to pay the Steam Direct Fee, which you
can do with any payment method that Steam supports in your country. <br />
<br />
You will be directed to the Steam store to complete the transaction, and then directed back to the
Steamworks website to continue with your paperwork. See

for more info.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="3"></a>Purchasing And Activating App Credit</h2>
Steamworks developers can easily buy additional app credits to prepare your next games for release
on Steam. <br />
<br />
The Steam Direct Fee may be paid with any payment method that Steam supports in your country,
excluding Steam wallet funds. Once the Steam Direct Fee is paid, an app credit will be attached to
the Steam account of the person who paid the fee. The credit can only be activated by the person who
paid the Steam Direct Fee.

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="4"></a>Recouping The Steam Direct Fee</h2>
The Steam Direct Fee is not refundable, but will be recoupable in the payment made after your
product has at least $1,000.00 Adjusted Gross Revenue for Steam Store or in-app purchases. The
recoupment of the Steam Direct Fee will be shown as a separate line item in your monthly report.
Payment of revenue from sales and repayment of fee may be withheld if deposit payment is
charged-back, refunded, or otherwise identified as fraudulent.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="5"></a>Taxes on the Steam Direct Fee</h2>
<br />
Valve will charge VAT, GST, or other similar consumption based taxes (if any) on the Steam Direct
Fee in accordance with country specific requirements.<br />
<br />
As all payments on the Steam Store, including that for the Steam Direct Fee, are made by individual
user accounts and not corporate accounts, the invoice for the Steam Direct Fee will also be issued
to the individual user that was logged in when the Steam Direct Fee was paid.<br />
<br />
Please note that Valve cannot issue double invoices for the same transaction; if you have paid the
Steam Direct Fee on behalf of another party such as your employer then the easiest solution is often
to file an expense report with them. Please consult your local tax advisor for specifics.<br />
