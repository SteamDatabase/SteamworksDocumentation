<h1>Managing Your Steamworks Account</h1>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Overview</h2>
Steamworks has a robust user-management tool that lets administrators define permissions for
accessing, editing, and publishing configuration and information for your applications on Steam.<br /><br />If
you are marked as an administrator for your Steamworks account, you can manage users and permissions
on the
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/pub/home/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
    >Users &amp; Permissions</a
>
page. If you are not an administrator, you will see a list of your administrators on the right side
of the
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/home/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
    >Steamworks home page</a
>
that you can contact to request additional permissions as appropriate.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="2"></a>Managing Users</h2>
In order for another user account to have access to any part of managing your game in Steamworks,
you will first need to add that user by sending them an invitation on the
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/pub/users/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
    >Add/Manage Users</a
>
page. The invitation process is as follows:<br /><br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        Enter the new user's email address. The email does not need to match any existing Steam
        account. <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        An email will be sent to the invitee notifying them of the invitation with a link to accept.
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Once accepted, you will receive an email notifying you that the invitee has accepted. You or
        another administrator in your Steamworks partner account will need to approve or reject the
        confirmation within 7 days.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Once confirmed, the invitee will receive a final email welcoming them to Steamworks and you
        will be able to add that user to any management groups with permissions for groups of games.
    </li>
</ul>
<br />Adding a user and selecting particular permissions will grant that user those permissions for
any applications currently in the "Everyone" group. The "Everyone" group is created automatically
for every Steamworks partner account. Users with admin permissions can remove specific applications
from the "Everyone" group if it is desired to manage more specific access to particular games via
groups.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="3"></a>User Invitation History</h2>
You can review a history of user invitations sent, pending, and confirmed in your Steamworks partner
via the
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/pub/userinvitehistory/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
    >User Invite History page</a
>.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="4"></a>User History</h2>
You can review a history of users in your Steamworks partner via the
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/pub/userhistory/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
    >User History page</a
>. There you can find a detailed report of when users were added or removed, by whom, and with which
permissions.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="5"></a>Managing Groups</h2>
Permissions for performing tasks within Steamworks are managed through groups. These groups are a
collection of applications and users, each with their own specific permissions for what they can
manage with regards to the applications in that group.<br /><br />Each partner account will have an
"Everyone" group with all the applications associated with that partner account. If you need to give
a user access to some applications in your partner account but not all, you can create a new group
and add that user to the group. The permissions that you specify for that user will only apply to
the applications in that group. To manage your groups, head to the
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/pub/groups/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
    >Add/Manage Group</a
>
page.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="6"></a>Granting Permissions</h2>
Administrators can only grant permissions that they have themselves. For example, if an
administrator does not have "Manage Pricing &amp; Discounts" on their account in the Everyone group,
then they will be unable to grant that permission to anyone.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="7"></a>Actual Authority</h2>
Actual Authority is a specific type of administrative rights which are handled differently than
other types of permissions. Actual Authority allows the user to:<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>view and make changes to bank account information<br /></li>
    <li>view and make changes to tax information <br /></li>
    <li>view and make changes to payment thresholds<br /></li>
    <li>sign legal agreements, and<br /></li>
    <li>initiate and accept transfers of applications.</li>
</ul>
<br />Accordingly, Actual Authority rights are limited. To request that a user be given Actual
Authority, please
<a
    href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/wizard/HelpWithPublishing?issueid=918"
    target="_blank"
    rel="noreferrer"
    >contact Steam Publishing</a
>. We recommend that you periodically review who has this level of rights.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="permissions"></a>User Permissions</h2>
There are two types of user permissions on Steamworks: Partner-level permissions and Group
Permissions.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="8"></a>Partner Permissions</h2>
Partner-level permissions are applied for the entire Steamworks partner account. Current permissions
include:<br /><br />
