<h1>ITrustService Interface</h1>
Provides access to the Steam Trust functionality. Steam Trust predicts the likelihood that an
account will receive a permanent ban in an application. <br />

Get the Trust Score for the specified user in the provided App ID. The returned trust_score is a
value in the range [0, 1000], where 0 represents 0%, 745 represents 74.5%, 1000 represents 100%,
etc. To mitigate bad actor behavior, the precision of the return values is gated by Steam on a
variety of factors, and is returned in the precision field of the response. For example, if the
returned precision value is 200 (the default), then the returned trust_score would be whichever of
the following values was closest to the user's true trust_score: (0, 200, 400, 600, 800, 1000).<br />
<br />
<strong>NOTE:</strong> Trust can only be used as a factor in matchmaking.<br />
<br />
<strong>NOTE:</strong> This call requires the publisher API key that owns the specified App ID to
use this method. As such this API <strong>MUST</strong> be called from a secure server, and can
never be used directly by clients!
