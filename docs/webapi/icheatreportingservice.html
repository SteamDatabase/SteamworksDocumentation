<h1>ICheatReportingService Interface</h1>
This service allows you to report cheating incidents and ban players from your game using the
<a href="/doc/features/anticheat#GameBans">Game Bans</a> system. It enables two similar workflows
for detecting and managing cheating in your game:<br />
<ul>
    <li>
        Gather community reports of cheating and issue bans/suspensions based upon this
        information.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Immediately ban a player with a 2 step process of reporting the cheating and then issuing a
        ban.
    </li>
</ul>
<br />
To use this interface you must first opt in to anti-cheat support. When enabling anti-cheat support
you may choose a 3rd party to grant access to the ICheatReportingService interface for your
application. This can be done from the
<a href="/apps/vac/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Anti-Cheat Configuration</a> page in the App
Admin panel.<br />
<br />
<strong>NOTE:</strong> This is a Service interface, methods in this interface should be called with
the <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">input_json</code> parameter.<br />
<br />

ReportPlayerCheating is designed to gather community reports of cheating, where one player reports
another player within the game.<br />
<br />
It is intended for unreliable data from peers in the game ( semi-trusted sources ). The back-end
that reports the data should ensure that both parties are authenticated, but the data in itself is
treated as hearsay. Optional parameters may be used to encode the type of cheating that is suspected
or additional evidence ( an identifier pointing to the match/demo for further review )<br />

Checks a user's VAC ban status and verifies a user's VAC session status. If verification fails, then
do not let the user matchmake into a secure game. <br />
<br />
This is used before a user enters matchmaking or joins a game. If the player is blocking VAC in some
way and VAC can not scan the computer for cheats, it will report success = true and session_verified
= false. Checking this webapi will allow you to prevent the user from matchmaking or joining a
server and then just getting kicked by VAC a short time later ( with a
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">k_EAuthSessionResponseVACCheckTimedOut</code>
result from an authentication callback ). The VAC system may not always have had time to fully
determine if the client's system is cooperating, and if so it will report success = false. It is
also possible for the player's system to pass the initial check but then fail to respond later, in
that case verification will succeed, but a
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">k_EAuthSessionResponseVACCheckTimedOut</code> may
follow later.<br />
