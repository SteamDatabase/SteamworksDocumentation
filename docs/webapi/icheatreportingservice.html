<h1>ICheatReportingService Interface</h1>
This service allows your game to report cheats and cheaters to the
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/features/anticheat#VAC" class="bb_doclink">VAC</a>
system and provides the toolset behind the
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/features/anticheat#GameBans" class="bb_doclink"
    >Game Bans</a
>
system. It enables two independent workflows for detecting and managing cheating in your game:<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        Gather community reports of cheating and request bans/suspensions based upon this
        information.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Submit detailed information about known cheat software to the VAC system. Once processed,
        this information will be used to automatically detect and ban players using known cheats.
    </li>
</ul>
<br />To use this interface you must first opt in to VAC support. This can be done from the
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/apps/vac/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
    >Anti-Cheat Configuration</a
>
page in the App Admin panel.<br /><br /><strong>NOTE:</strong> This is a Service interface, methods
in this interface should be called with the
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">input_json</code> parameter.<br /><br />For more
info on how to use the Steamworks Web API please see the

<br />ReportPlayerCheating is designed to gather community reports of cheating, where one player
reports another player within the game.<br /><br />It is intended for unreliable data from peers in
the game ( semi-trusted sources ). The back-end that reports the data should ensure that both
parties are authenticated, but the data in itself is treated as hearsay. Optional parameters may be
used to encode the type of cheating that is suspected or additional evidence ( an identifier
pointing to the match/demo for further review )<br /><br /><strong>NOTE:</strong> This call requires
a publisher API key to use this method. As such this API <strong>MUST</strong> be called from a
secure server, and can never be used directly by clients!

<br />Reports cheat data. Only use on test account that is running the game but not in a multiplayer
session.<br /><br />This is for reporting specific cheats to the VAC system. This is done by running
the cheat and the game and then calling this webapi.
<div class="bb_callout bb_red bb_fixed">
    <div>
        <strong>NOTE:</strong> Because of this you should only use a test account on a disposable
        machine outside your network. You must also use a standard Web API key obtained from
        <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/developer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
            >http://steamcommunity.com/developer</a
        >
        for that test account, not a partner Web API key. After calling this, the system should be
        left idle for at least a half an hour so that VAC may fully scan the system. The test
        account will be flagged and not allowed to authenticate into multiplayer games in the
        future, so be sure to always use a test account that is for cheat reporting only.

webapi will allow you to prevent the user from matchmaking or joining a server and then just getting
kicked by VAC a short time later ( with a
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">k_EAuthSessionResponseVACCheckTimedOut</code>
result from an authentication callback ). The VAC system may not always have had time to fully
determine if the clients system is cooperating, and if so it will report success = false. It is also
possible for the players system to pass the initial check but then fail to respond later, in that
case verification will succeed, but a
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">k_EAuthSessionResponseVACCheckTimedOut</code> may
follow later.<br /><br /><br /><strong>NOTE:</strong> This call requires a publisher API key to use
this method. As such this API <strong>MUST</strong> be called from a secure server, and can never be
used directly by clients!
