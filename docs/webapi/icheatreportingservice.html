<h1>ICheatReportingService Interface</h1>
This service allows your game to report cheats and cheaters to the
<a href="/doc/features/anticheat#VAC">VAC</a> system and provides the toolset behind the
<a href="/doc/features/anticheat#GameBans">Game Bans</a> system. It enables two independent
workflows for detecting and managing cheating in your game:<br />
<ul>
    <li>
        Gather community reports of cheating and request bans/suspensions based upon this
        information.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Submit detailed information about known cheat software to the VAC system. Once processed,
        this information will be used to automatically detect and ban players using known cheats.
    </li>
</ul>
<br />
To use this interface you must first opt in to VAC support. This can be done from the
<a href="/apps/vac/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Anti-Cheat Configuration</a> page in the App
Admin panel.<br />
<br />
<strong>NOTE:</strong> This is a Service interface, methods in this interface should be called with
the <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">input_json</code> parameter.<br />
<br />

ReportPlayerCheating is designed to gather community reports of cheating, where one player reports
another player within the game.<br />
<br />
It is intended for unreliable data from peers in the game ( semi-trusted sources ). The back-end
that reports the data should ensure that both parties are authenticated, but the data in itself is
treated as hearsay. Optional parameters may be used to encode the type of cheating that is suspected
or additional evidence ( an identifier pointing to the match/demo for further review )<br />

Reports cheat data. Only use on test account that is running the game but not in a multiplayer
session.<br />
<br />
This is for reporting specific cheats to the VAC system. This is done by running the cheat and the
game and then calling this webapi.
<div class="bb_callout bb_red bb_fixed">
    <div>
        <strong>NOTE:</strong> Because of this you should only use a test account on a disposable
        machine outside your network. You must also use a standard Web API key obtained from
        <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/developer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
            >http://steamcommunity.com/developer</a
        >
        for that test account, not a partner Web API key. After calling this, the system should be
        left idle for at least a half an hour so that VAC may fully scan the system. The test
        account will be flagged and not allowed to authenticate into multiplayer games in the
        future, so be sure to always use a test account that is for cheat reporting only.

Checks a user's VAC ban status and verifies a user's VAC session status. If verification fails, then
do not let the user matchmake into a secure game. <br />
<br />
This is used before a user enters matchmaking or joins a game. If the player is blocking VAC in some
way and VAC can not scan the computer for cheats, it will report success = true and session_verified
= false. Checking this webapi will allow you to prevent the user from matchmaking or joining a
server and then just getting kicked by VAC a short time later ( with a
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">k_EAuthSessionResponseVACCheckTimedOut</code>
result from an authentication callback ). The VAC system may not always have had time to fully
determine if the clients system is cooperating, and if so it will report success = false. It is also
possible for the players system to pass the initial check but then fail to respond later, in that
case verification will succeed, but a
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">k_EAuthSessionResponseVACCheckTimedOut</code> may
follow later.<br />
