            <td>
                An Application (or App) is the main representation of a product on Steam. An App
                generally has its own store page, it's own Community Hub, and is what appears in
                customers' libraries.

            <td>
                You can put up a Coming Soon page for your product well in advance of your release
                date. This way, you can let customers know the title is coming to Steam and start
                building an audience and excitement around your product.

            <td>
                Steam Early Access enables you to sell your game on Steam while it is still being
                developed, and provide context to customers that a product should be considered
                "unfinished." Early Access is a place for games that are in a playable alpha or beta
                state, are worth the current value of the playable build, and that you plan to
                continue to develop for release.

                software, or VR experience, and then linking each to a franchise homepage.

            <td>
                As part of the release process on Steam, you will be required to deliver various
                graphical assets for your product. These are displayed in different places on the
                Steam store and in customer's libraries.

            <td>
                Steam is a global platform and thus supports multiple languages across many platform
                features. Over 60% of Steam users use it in a language other than English, so
                tailoring your experience for those users is important. Supporting as many
                languages, currencies and payment methods as possible enables Steam to provide the
                best experience possible to customers around the world. This guide explains how
                languages are supported across Steam.

            <td>
                Our experience with pre-purchases is that they tend to be ineffective unless itâ€™s a
                heavily anticipated, heavily marketed title, and even then we encourage titles to
                have short pre-purchase periods on Steam.

            <td>
                Partners on Steam are responsible for setting and managing pricing for their
                products. The Steamworks Developer site provides tools to configure pricing and
                discounts in all the currencies supported by Steam.

            <td>
                The release of your product is mostly in your hands, though Valve will need to
                review and approve your product before release. You can pick the date that it should
                release and you can configure most features yourself. The general process for
                launching your product on Steam is displayed at the top of your product landing page
                in Steamworks.

                If you need to stop selling your product for some reason, Valve can help you make
                the necessary changes. This documentation will be helpful if you are cancelling or
                retiring a game, or if you have lost distribution rights and need to stop selling a
                title.

            <td>
                Once you have completed your checklists, your store presence and product build will
                need to be reviewed by Valve before you can release your game or software. You'll
                need to click "Mark as ready for review" to communicate to Valve that you have
                completed the necessary work items and are ready for your store page and proposed
                pricing to be reviewed.

                Tags are terms that can be applied to your game, and visible on your store page.
                Tags are an important set of metadata that helps describe a game to customers and
                helps Steam figure out how best to recommend your game.

                As part of the release process on Steam, you will be required to upload a trailer
                for your product. Trailers are displayed at the top of your product's store page and
                are often one of the first things your potential customers will be seeing.

                prominent one on the homepage of Steam. You can also find them when browsing any

            <td>
                Users that have recorded playtime on your product on Steam can write reviews and
                indicate whether they recommend your product to others. These reviews may appear on
                your product's store page and in the Steam Community, depending on how many other
                users find that review helpful. The aggregate of positive and negative reviews is
                used to calculate a review score which is also displayed on your store page, giving
                an overview of how customers have reviewed your product in the last 30 days and over
                its lifetime.
