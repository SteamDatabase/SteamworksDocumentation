            An Application (or App) is the main representation of a product on Steam. An App
            generally has its own store page, it's own Community Hub, and is what appears in
            customers' libraries.

        <td>
            You can put up a Coming Soon page for your product well in advance of your release date.
            This way, you can let customers know the title is coming to Steam and start building an
            audience and excitement around your product.

            Steam Early Access enables you to sell your game on Steam while it is still being
            developed, and provide context to customers that a product should be considered
            "unfinished." Early Access is a place for games that are in a playable alpha or beta
            state, are worth the current value of the playable build, and that you plan to continue
            to develop for release.

        <td>
            Steam is a global platform and thus supports multiple languages across many platform
            features. Over 60% of Steam users use it in a language other than English, so tailoring
            your experience for those users is important. Supporting as many languages, currencies
            and payment methods as possible enables Steam to provide the best experience possible to
            customers around the world. This guide explains how languages are supported across
            Steam.

        <td>
            Our experience with pre-purchases is that they tend to be ineffective unless it’s a
            heavily anticipated, heavily marketed title, and even then we encourage titles to have
            short pre-purchase periods on Steam.

            The release of your product is mostly in your hands, though Valve will need to review
            and approve your product before release. You can pick the date that it should release
            and you can configure most features yourself. The general process for launching your
            product on Steam is displayed at the top of your product landing page in Steamworks.

            If you need to stop selling your product for some reason, Valve can help you make the
            necessary changes. This documentation will be helpful if you are cancelling or retiring
            a game, or if you have lost distribution rights and need to stop selling a title.

            Once you have completed your checklists, your store presence and product build will need
            to be reviewed by Valve before you can release your game or software. You'll need to
            click "Mark as ready for review" to communicate to Valve that you have completed the
            necessary work items and are ready for your store page and proposed pricing to be
            reviewed.

            Tags are terms that can be applied to your game, and visible on your store page. Tags

            Users that have recorded playtime on your product on Steam can write reviews and
            indicate whether they recommend your product to others. These reviews may appear on your
            product's store page and in the Steam Community, depending on how many other users find
            that review helpful. The aggregate of positive and negative reviews is used to calculate
            a review score which is also displayed on your store page, giving an overview of how
            customers have reviewed your product in the last 30 days and over its lifetime.
