<h1>Steam Frame Controllers</h1>
The Steam Frame Controllers have the same capabilities as your standard console gaming controllers
plus touch states, grip buttons, capacitive finger tracking, and 6-DOF spatial tracking. This gives
you many more options on how to let players interact with your titles. It also allows users to play
non-VR content on the headset without a separate device.<br />

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>VR Compatibility</h2>
While you will always get a better user experience by tailoring your title to the Frame Controllers
specifically, our controller compatibility modes have become quite robust. SteamVR will always use a
Frame Controller binding by default but in the case one is not available it will first look for a

binding, then an

binding, and remap those to the Frame Controller layout. <br />
<ul>
    <li>
        The menu button on Oculus Touch will map to the View button at the top of the Steam Frame
        Controller.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        The top button of the Oculus Touch controllers (B / Y) will map to all three top buttons of
        the Steam Frame Controllers (Dpad Left, Dpad Up, Dpad Right / X, Y, B).
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="2"></a>Non-VR Compatibility</h2>
When playing Non-VR titles locally or via streaming the Frame Controllers take full advantage of
<a href="/doc/features/steam_controller">Steam Input</a>. Depending on the game and the configured
bindings it will show up as a generic gamepad or keyboard/mouse.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="3"></a>OpenXR Interaction Profile</h2>
You'll find an OpenXR Interaction Profile included in each Game Engine plugin (or in the case of
Godot in the engine itself). If you have your own custom engine you can add support via our
extension detailed on the <a href="/doc/steamframe/engines/custom">Custom Engines</a> documentation
page.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="4"></a>OpenVR Bindings</h2>
You can bind to the Steam Frame Controllers like you would any other OpenVR controller type. Its
controller_type is "frame_controller". They support finger tracking via the

and all of the controls listed above. You can create bindings for it in the SteamVR Binding UI.<br />
