<h1>Setting up your Steam Frame for development</h1>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Power</h2>
The headset ships in a special mode that requires plugging into power first.&nbsp; Ensure your power
adapter supports a minimum of 27W (45W recommended). After you have plugged it in, press the power
button to turn it on, then follow the in headset instructions to get through the initial
update.&nbsp; After the headset reboots, log into Steam.<br />

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="2"></a>Developer Mode</h2>
When you get your frame the first thing you will want to do is turn on
<strong>Developer Mode</strong>. This will allow you to <strong>ssh</strong>, <strong>adb</strong>,
and <strong>rdp</strong> into your headset. You will find this at
<strong>Steam Settings &gt; System &gt; Enable Developer Mode</strong>.<br />

<br />
Then on the left, scroll down to the <strong>Developer</strong> section, scroll toward the bottom of
that page and click <strong>Set User Password</strong>.<br />

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="3"></a>Beta</h2>
For the latest updates, it is recommended to opt into the beta versions of both the Steam client and
SteamVR on PC.<br />
<br />
For the Steam client, on your Desktop PC go to
<strong>Steam Settings &gt; Interface &gt; Client Beta Participation</strong> and select
<strong>Steam Beta Update</strong>. Steam will restart.<br />
<br />

    title="steamframe-steambeta.png"
/><br />
<br />
For SteamVR, go to its app page in your <strong>Steam Library</strong> (still on your Desktop PC),
click the gear icon, select <strong>Properties &gt; Betas &gt; Beta Participation</strong> and
select <strong>SteamVR Beta Update</strong>.<br />
<br />

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="4"></a>Streaming</h2>
Plug the included wireless adapter into your PC (preferably a USB-3 port), launch SteamVR, and
accept the prompt to install its driver.<br />

    title="steamframe-wirelessadapter.png"
/><br />
<br />
<strong>Select Yes </strong>when prompted to pair, then <strong>enter the code</strong> in your
headset using the virtual keyboard.<br />
<br />

<div class="bb_callout">
    <div>
        If the prompt never appears, ensure you are opted into the Steam Beta Update. Or you may
        need to reboot your PC for the driver installation to take effect. If still not prompted,
        try restarting your headset, and ensure it is logged into the same Steam account.
    </div>
</div>
<br />
Once paired, in headset point at the time in the dashboard bar to bring up
<strong>Quick Settings</strong>.&nbsp; You should see your PC’s name under
<strong>Other</strong>.&nbsp; Click your PC's name to connect.&nbsp; This will launch SteamVR on
your PC, and your Steam Frame should now act just like any normal wired headset (sans wires).<br />

/><br />
<br />
<i
    >Note: SteamVR will automatically reconnect to the last wireless headset it was launched with,
    so you can just launch SteamVR from the PC rather than needing to initiate from in-headset each
    time. If you still have a wired headset plugged into the PC, you may need to unplug that first.
    This "direct" mode is primarily intended for development. Normally, you'd just click
    <strong>Stream </strong>on games in your <strong>Steam Library</strong> in headset.</i

<div class="bb_callout">
    <div>
        You can also stream over your home Wi-Fi, but that tends to be more congested and less
        reliable than the direct connection the wireless adapter affords.
    </div>

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="5"></a>Pairing Controllers</h2>
Your controllers should automatically pair when first turned on and are seen by the headset. To turn
on your controllers, press the button with the Steam logo. If they do not turn on, verify the tab
has been removed from the battery compartment. They will turn off automatically when not in use for
a period of time.<br />
<br />
If they do not show up in headset (while the dashboard is up) at this point, they may need to be
manually paired. You can navigate the initial menus to log in using the Aux button, which is on the
right hand side of headset just above the power button.<br />
<br />
Once logged-in, on the dashboard side menu, click the VR Settings icon (HMD) on the left side of the
screen.&nbsp; Under this menu, click <strong>Controllers</strong>, then
<strong>Pair Controllers</strong>.<br />
<br />
Put a controller in pairing mode by holding down the Steam button and the thin button at the top of
the controller (either View or Menu) at the same time until the controller beeps. Then click the
<strong>Pair</strong> button to complete pairing. Repeat for the other controller.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="6"></a>Changing Your Device Name</h2>
If you are in an office full of other Steam Frames you will want to rename your device so you don't
cause network collisions. Once you are logged in you can go to
<strong>Steam Settings &gt; System &gt; Hostname</strong> and change it to whatever you like. Then
anywhere in these documents you see <strong>frame</strong> as a hostname, just know to change it to
whatever you have set here.<br />
