<h1>Connecting adb to Lepton</h1>
Android Debug Bridge (ADB) is a tool for communicating with a mobile device from a PC and can be
<a

    target="_blank"
    rel="noreferrer"
    >downloaded from Google here</a
>. It is also included with Android Studio.<br />
<br />
Lepton is a container for running Android apps on Linux devices such as Steam Frame. There is no
Lepton container running by default on Steam Frame, so adb will not have anything to connect to
until we start one. You can do this by going to your Steam Library on the Steam Frame, find "Lepton
Development" and start the application. You should see a floating window appear with an Android home
screen.<br />
<br />
<i
    >Note: Launching any Android game from Steam starts a Lepton container and can be connected
    similarly without needing to launch Lepton Development separately</i
>. <br />
<br />
First, make sure you have turned on Developer Mode as described in the
<a href="/doc/steamframe/setup">Setting up your Steam Frame for development</a> this will let you
connect and deploy to the headset.

<h3>Connecting via Wifi</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Open a command prompt to where you downloaded adb.exe<br /></li>
    <li>
        Run <strong>adb connect frame</strong>
        <i
            >(or substitute <strong>frame</strong> for your current hostname if you've changed
            it.)</i
        >
    </li>
</ol>
<h3>Connecting via USB</h3>
By default, adb over USB will connect to the native Linux OS, while Lepton instead listens on tcp
port 5555. So to connect to Lepton over USB using adb you first need to forward that port and then
explicitly connect to it.<br />
<ol>
    <li>Open a command prompt to where you downloaded adb.exe<br /></li>
    <li>Run <strong>adb forward tcp:5555 tcp:5555</strong><br /></li>
    <li>Run <strong>adb connect localhost:5555</strong></li>
</ol>
<br />
<i
    >Note: Your PC likely does not provide enough power over USB to keep the headset running. If you
    prefer this method you'll want to get a cable or adapter that allows you to connect a separate
    power source.</i
><br />
<br />
Once you have run <strong>adb connect</strong> you should see:<br />
<div class="bb_code">connected to frame:5555</div>
<br />
This means you're successfully connected to the device, and can now deploy builds like you would to
any other Android device!
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="2"></a>Troubleshooting</h2>
If you get an error, ensure:<br />
<ul>
    <li>A Lepton development session is currently running<br /></li>
    <li>The Steam Frame is connected to the same network as your PC<br /></li>
    <li>Your router doesn't have "client isolation" enabled<br /></li>
    <li>
        You don't have multiple devices on the same network with the same hostname (2 different
        Steam Frames with the default hostname <strong>frame</strong>)
    </li>
</ul>
<br />
If you see:<br />
<div class="bb_code">cannot resolve host 'frame' and port 5555: No such host is known. (11001)</div>
You may need to use the headset's IP address instead. This can be found by clicking on your wifi
network in headset under <strong>Quick Settings</strong> or
<strong>Steam Settings &gt; Internet</strong> (Example: 192.168.4.80).<br />
