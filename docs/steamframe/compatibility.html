<h1>What games can run standalone on Steam Frame</h1>
We think customers are better off if a developer can focus on the one best version of their game,
rather than making and maintaining many separate builds-- especially if one build ends up as a
second-class experience missing some testing or updates. We've spent a lot of effort making it as
easy as possible to run that best version on Steam Frame. For most developers that probably means
running Windows x86 via Proton and FEX.<br />
<br />
For VR developers that have already spent the effort to make a mobile optimized version of their
game for other hardware (typically Android Arm64), we think it makes sense to run that version on
Steam Frame.<br />
<br />
Steam Frame natively runs a Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 (Arm64) chip on
<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamos" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">SteamOS</a> (Linux
Arch-based) and includes a range of compatibility layers for other Operating Systems and
architectures.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="1"></a>Windows via Proton</h2>
Windows games can be run via
<a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Proton</a>.
Proton is a compatibility layer that allows Windows games to run on Linux by using a modified
version of Wine and a collection of high-performance graphics API implementations such as
<a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">dxvk</a> which
translates DirectX to Vulkan (Steam Frame's native graphics API).
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="2"></a>Android via Lepton</h2>
Android games can be run via Lepton. Lepton is a compatibility layer that allows Android games to
run on Linux. It is implemented as a container to minimize overhead.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="3"></a>x86 via FEX</h2>
x86 (32-bit and 64-bit) via
<a href="https://github.com/FEX-Emu/FEX" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">FEX</a>. FEX translates
x86 compiled games to Arm64 instructions, but forwards API calls to native host system libraries
like OpenGL or Vulkan to reduce emulation overhead, and leverages code caching to minimize in-game
stuttering as much as possible.<br />
