New to Steam or looking for a refresher on important topics?<br />
<br />
Our most useful and popular documentation pages are listed below, sorted by function. This is

One of the first things to understand is that Steam refers to the customer-facing platform where
customers buy games, write reviews, discuss game strategies, post screenshots, and more. Steamworks
is the backend platform that holds the tools that allow developers and publishers to make changes to
their public-facing Steam pages, upload builds, manage their banking information, and more.
