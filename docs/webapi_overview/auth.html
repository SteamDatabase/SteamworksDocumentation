<h1>Authentication using Web API Keys</h1>
Some Web API methods return publicly accessible data and do not require
authorization when called. Other methods may require you to use a unique API
key. There are also methods that return sensitive data or perform a protected
action and require special access permissions. These APIs require a publisher
key, which you will need to create before calling any of them. In cases where an
API key is required, it can be provided either as a standard parameter or by
setting the 'x-webapi-key' request header value.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="user-keys"></a>User Keys</h2>
The standard user keys are available to everyone, all that is required is a
Steam account and the domain name that will be associated with this key.<br /><br />You
will also need to agree to the

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="publisher-keys"></a>Publisher Keys</h2>
To securely identify a publisher, and allow access to protected methods, a
publisher may request a Web API key which can be passed to the appropriate
methods using the key parameter. Each key is associated with a publisher group
and can be used to access data for all of the App IDs that are also associated
with that group. To receive a publisher Web API key, see Creating a Publisher
Key below.<br /><br />Publisher Web API keys provide access to sensitive user
data and protected methods. These keys are intended to be used for Web API
requests that originate from secure publisher servers. The keys must be stored
securely, and must not be distributed with a game client. All Web API requests
that contain Web API keys should be made over HTTPS.

</h2>
To create a publisher Web API key, you will need to have administrator
permissions within an existing Steamworks account. If you are not an
administrator yourself, you can see a list of administrators for your partner
account by visiting your Steamworks Home Page and viewing the list on the
right-hand side. Any one of them can create your Publisher Web API Key or can
promote you to admin if appropriate.<br /><br />To create a Publisher Web API
key:<br />
<ol class="bb_ol">
  <li>
    As a user with administrative rights in your Steamworks account, first visit
    your groups list.<br />
  </li>
  <li>
    From the list of groups, select or create a group that contains the App IDs
    for which you wish to have access with the WebAPI key.<br />
  </li>
  <li>
    Then click into that group to view the users and applications in that
    group.<br />
  </li>
  <li>
    If you have administrative permissions, you should then see the option to
    "Create WebAPI Key" on the right-hand side. Or you should see the key listed
    if it has already been created.
  </li>
</ol>
