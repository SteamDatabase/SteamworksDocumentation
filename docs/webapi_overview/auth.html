<h1>Authentication using Web API Keys</h1>
Some Web API methods return publicly accessible data and do not require authorization when called.
Other methods may require you to use a unique API key. There are also methods that return sensitive
data or perform a protected action and require special access permissions. These APIs require a
publisher key, which you will need to create before calling any of them. In cases where an API key
is required, it can be provided either as a standard parameter or by setting the 'x-webapi-key'
request header value.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="user-keys"></a>User Keys</h2>
The standard user keys are available to everyone, all that is required is a Steam account and the
domain name that will be associated with this key.<br />
<br />
You will also need to agree to the
<a href="http://steamcommunity.com/dev/apiterms" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
    >Steam Web API Terms of Use</a
>.<br />
<br />
You can create a user Web API key from the
<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
    >registration page on the Steam Community</a
>.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="publisher-keys"></a>Publisher Keys</h2>
To securely identify a publisher, and allow access to protected methods, a publisher may request a
Web API key which can be passed to the appropriate methods using the key parameter. Each key is
associated with a publisher group and can be used to access data for all of the App IDs that are
also associated with that group. To receive a publisher Web API key, see Creating a Publisher Key
below.<br />
<br />
Publisher Web API keys provide access to sensitive user data and protected methods. These keys are
intended to be used for Web API requests that originate from secure publisher servers. The keys must
be stored securely, and must not be distributed with a game client. All Web API requests that
contain Web API keys should be made over HTTPS.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="create_publisher_key"></a>Creating a Publisher Web API Key</h2>
To create a publisher Web API key, you will need to have administrator permissions within an
existing Steamworks account. If you are not an administrator yourself, you can see a list of
administrators for your partner account by visiting your Steamworks Home Page and viewing the list
on the right-hand side. Any one of them can create your Publisher Web API Key or can promote you to
admin if appropriate.<br />
<br />
To create a Publisher Web API key:<br />
<ol>
    <li>
        As a user with administrative rights in your Steamworks account, first visit your groups
        list by going to Users &amp; Permissions, then Manage Groups.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        From the list of groups, select or create a group that contains the App IDs for which you
        wish to have access with the WebAPI key.<br />
    </li>
    <li>Then click into that group to view the users and applications in that group.<br /></li>
    <li>
        If you have administrative permissions, you should then see the option to "Create WebAPI
        Key" on the right-hand side. Or you should see the key listed if it has already been
        created.
    </li>
</ol>
