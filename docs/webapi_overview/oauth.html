<h1>OAuth</h1>
OAuth allows partner sites and applications on embedded platforms to perform certain operations on
behalf of authenticated Steam users in a secure manner.<br />
<br />
To use OAuth, first you will need to obtain a <strong>Client ID</strong> from Valve. See
<strong>Getting Started</strong> for more detail.<br />
<br />
Some OAuth APIs also require a <a href="/doc/webapi_overview/auth">WebAPI publisher key</a> to
validate your identity as a Steam partner. These APIs can only be called from your servers, as the
key cannot be shared with clients. Such APIs will be indicated by the presence of a
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">key</code> parameter.<br />
<br />
WebAPI services with OAuth-enabled methods include:
<a href="/doc/webapi/ICloudService">ICloudService</a>,
<a href="/doc/webapi/IBroadcastService">IBroadcastService</a>,
<a href="/doc/webapi/IGameNotificationsService">IGameNotificationsService</a>,
<a href="/doc/webapi/IPlayerService">IPlayerService</a>, and
<a href="/doc/webapi/IPublishedFileService">IPublishedFileService</a>.<br />
<br />
For the sake of illustration,
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">http://redirect/uri/here</code> will be used to
represent the redirect URI.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="Getting+Started"></a>Getting Started</h2>
<br />
Steam's implementation is based upon
<a href="http://oauth.net/2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">OAuth 2.0</a>.<br />
During your initial setup you will need to contact Valve with the following information:<br />
<ul>
    <li>
        What permissions you need the user to obtain. The required permissions are listed below with
        each API call. Note that if you are not planning on supporting cross-platform Cloud sync or
        Workshop support, we will not provide you with a Client ID.<br />
    </li>
    <li>The token lifetime.<br /></li>
    <li>
        The redirect URI to send the user back to after completing authentication/authorization.
    </li>
</ul>
In return, Valve will assign a <strong>Client ID</strong> for your implementation.<br />
<br />
To authenticate a user, redirect the user to<br />
<br />
<div class="bb_code">
    https://steamcommunity.com/oauth/login?response_type=token&amp;client_id=client_id_here&amp;state=whatever_you_want
</div>
<br />
Adding <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">&amp;mobileminimal=1</code> to the above
request is recommended for embedded browsers, as it removes some of the Steam site navigation UI
that will not be relevant when the OAuth page is presented directly to a user within your game.<br />
<br />
If you include the state parameter, it will be passed back to the redirect URI after the user has
confirmed or denied access. Note that the authorization code grant type is also supported, by using
the response_type=code during login.<br />
<br />
If the user grants access, they will be redirected back to you at <br />
<br />
<div class="bb_code">
    http://redirect/uri/here#access_token=token_here&amp;token_type=steam&amp;state=whatever_you_want
</div>
<br />
The token should be treated as an opaque string. Tokens are currently 32-character hexadecimal
strings, but that is subject to change. This API also includes a deprecated steamid parameter, which
must be ignored. Please check
<a href="/doc/webapi_overview/oauth#RetrieveSteamID">Retrieving the User's SteamID</a> below for how
to retrieve the user's SteamID securely.<br />
<br />
If the user denies access, they will be redirected back to you at <br />
<br />
<div class="bb_code">http://redirect/uri/here#error=access_denied&amp;state=whatever_you_want</div>
<br />
Note that the response (including the token) is provided in the URI fragment, so it will need to be
accessed client-side and passed back to your server if you need to do server-side requests.<br />
<br />
Once you have the user's token, you can begin API requests as documented below.<br />
Unless others noted below, requests should be HTTP POST requests presented as form data and should
set this header:<br />
<br />
<div class="bb_code">Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded</div>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="RetrieveSteamID"></a>Retrieving the User's SteamID</h2>
Once you have an OAuth token for a user, you can make a server to server call to securely get the
SteamID for the user associated with that token by calling:<br />
<br />
<div class="bb_code">
    https://api.steampowered.com/ISteamUserOAuth/GetTokenDetails/v1/?access_token=token
</div>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="Cloud"></a>Accessing Steam Cloud</h2>
<br />
To access Steam Cloud on behalf of a user, your OAuth client will need the
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">read_cloud</code> and/or
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">write_cloud</code> permission(s).<br />
These permissions are scoped by AppId, so make sure to specify all AppIds which should be include
when creating your Client ID.<br />
<br />
Once you have the OAuth token, use the <a href="/doc/webapi/ICloudService">ICloudService</a> Steam
WebAPI.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="Workshop"></a>Accessing Steam Workshop</h2>
<br />
To access Steam Workshop on behalf of a user, your OAuth client will need the
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">read_cloud</code> and/or
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">write_cloud</code> permission(s).<br />
These permissions are scoped by AppId, so make sure to specify all AppIds which should be include
when creating your Client ID.<br />
<br />
Once you have the OAuth token, use the
<a href="/doc/webapi/IPublishedFileService">IPublishedFileService</a> Steam WebAPI.<br />
<br />
<br />
