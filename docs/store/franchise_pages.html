<h1>Franchise Pages</h1>
You can now formally link related games by defining and setting a franchise for each game, movie,
software, or VR experience, and then linking each to a franchise homepage. This document covers the
why and how.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="1"></a>What is a franchise?</h2>
A franchise is typically defined as a set of titles that are built in the same fictional universe,
gameplay style, or intellectual property. For example, "Total War" is a franchise made up of a dozen
or so individual games that share a common gameplay style. "Assassin's Creed" is also a franchise
made up of a number of games that share gameplay style and also share a narrative story line that
runs across all the titles.<br />

<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="2"></a>Why create a franchises page?</h2>
Similar to <a href="/doc/store/creator_homepage">Developer and Publisher Homepages</a>, setting up a
franchise page allows you to organize your titles in logical formats and allows fans to follow your
entire franchise to be notified of future releases.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="3"></a>Creating a franchise page</h2>
You'll first want to think about what the name of your franchise is and what set of games, videos,
DLC, software, or VR experiences comprises that franchise.<br />
<br />
Then you'll need to take a couple of steps for each title that should be part of that franchise in
Steam:<br />
<ol>
    <li>
        <strong>Set the ‘franchise’ on each game</strong> - In the ‘edit store page’ section for any
        of your games (right below where you set developer and publisher), you'll need to specify
        the franchise name you want to use and then switch to the 'publish' tab and publish your
        store page changes. You only need to do this for base games--any DLC will automatically
        inherit franchise name from its parent game.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Create a group</strong> - You'll first need to be an owner or officer in a group
        that you wish to serve as the foundation for your franchise homepage. As with developer
        homepages, you'll want to create a group with the name of your franchise.
        <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/actions/GroupCreate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
            >Create a new group</a
        >
        or use an existing group you may have set up in the past with your franchise name.
        <a
            href="https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=2092-QLZX-8453"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noreferrer"
            >Learn more about Steam Community groups</a
        ><br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Link your games to a homepage</strong> - Then you can use the
        <a href="/creatorhome/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">homepage linking interface</a> to
        link your franchise name to your community group to create a homepage.
    </li>
</ol>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="4"></a>How franchises appear in Steam</h2>
We set one up for Half-Life games as an example:
<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/franchise/Half-Life" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
    >https://store.steampowered.com/franchise/Half-Life</a
><br />
<br />
Once a franchise is established on each game in the franchise, it will be surfaced in a number of
ways.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="5"></a>In a button above purchase options</h2>
Each game in the franchise will have a new button above the purchase options, leading to the
franchise page. This button automatically uses the header image that you uploaded to your franchise
page.<br />
<br />
<img
    src="https://cdn.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/FranchiseButtonExample.jpg"
    alt="FranchiseButtonExample.jpg"
    title="FranchiseButtonExample.jpg"
/>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="6"></a>In "More From Franchise" section</h2>
Each game in the franchise will then have a new section below the system requirements that displays
the other games in the franchise. Here is what it looks like on the Half-Life store page:<br />
<br />
<img
    src="https://cdn.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/halflifefranchise.PNG"
    alt="halflifefranchise.PNG"
    title="halflifefranchise.PNG"
/><br />
<br />
Developers can control which developer, publisher, or franchise is highlighted below each game’s
written description. These controls will let creators specify the set of games to draw from, as well
as the sort order for those games, and set one or more of the included games to force to the front
of the list. This functionality will help players find other games from your developer or publisher
or franchise without being intrusive or getting in the way of learning or playing the game they are
looking at. You can find this option within the ‘Special Settings’ tab of your store page editor.<br />
<br />

    alt="halflifespecialsettings.PNG"
    title="halflifespecialsettings.PNG"
/>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="7"></a>In navigation breadcrumbs</h2>
Each game in the franchise will also show the franchise name as a navigation item in the breadcrumbs
at the top of the store page. This links back to your franchise page as well<br />
<br />

    src="https://cdn.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/halflife_franchise_breadcrumbs_01.jpg"
    alt="halflife_franchise_breadcrumbs_01.jpg"
    title="halflife_franchise_breadcrumbs_01.jpg"
/>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="8"></a>Featured on a developer/publisher homepage</h2>
You can also highlight one or more franchises on your developer or publisher homepage. This takes a
small amount of configuration to appear, so read on below for more details on setting this up.<br />
<br />
<img
    src="https://cdn.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/our_franchises_02.jpg"
    alt="our_franchises_02.jpg"
    title="our_franchises_02.jpg"
/>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="9"></a>Highlight franchises on your homepage</h2>
Now you can customize your sections on your homepage to show a list of your franchises.<br />
<br />
When editing the sections on your developer or publisher homepage, select “Link your Homepages” from
the type picker. Then you can choose the title for the section depending on whether you are going to
show a list of associated studios or a list of your franchises (This just determines the title for
the section to explain the contents to customers).<br />
<br />
<img
    src="https://cdn.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/our_franchises_01.jpg"
    alt="our_franchises_01.jpg"
    title="our_franchises_01.jpg"
/><br />
<br />
The items with checkboxes here are populated by the list of homepages that the current user has
officer permissions in.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="10"></a>Franchises across different companies</h2>
All of this already works across different Steamworks developer accounts too. For example, a couple
different companies make games in the “Warhammer” franchise. So the various studios just need to be
officers in a "Warhammer" community group and then could each link their own appropriate games to
the franchise page.

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="11"></a>Following a franchise</h2>
Once a franchise page is created, fans can start to follow the franchise. This has many of the same
benefits of following a developer, except that it is scoped to just products that are part of that
franchise.<br />
<br />
When a Steam customer follows your franchise, they are giving Steam a strong signal that they enjoy
that content and allows Steam to expand the customer store experience in the following ways:<br />
<br />
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Email notification</strong> - Followers will receive an email when a game in your
        franchise releases or enters early access or exits early access. For example: <br />
        <br />
        <img
            src="https://cdn.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/NewReleaseLaunchEmail.png"
            alt="New release launch emails example"
            title="New release launch emails example"
        /><br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Featuring games</strong> - When followers are browsing either the Steam front page
        or a genre and/or tag Steam hub page, Steam will mix in recently released games from the
        franchise into the main capsules on those pages. We will also remind those followers why we
        are showing them that particular game.<br />
        <br />
        <img
            src="https://cdn.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/HubFollowDigitalExtremes.png"
            alt="Recent release on a hub"
            title="Recent release on a hub"
        /><br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Game relevancy info</strong> - The individual product page will highlight that they
        follow your franchise as a reason why this game is relevant to them.<br />
        <br />
        <img
            src="https://cdn.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/PublishedBySomeoneYouFollow.png"
            alt="Publisher you follow"
            title="Publisher you follow"
        />
    </li>
</ul>
