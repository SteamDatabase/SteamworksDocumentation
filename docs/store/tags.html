<h1>Steam Tags</h1>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Steam Tags</h2>
In addition to helping Steam users quickly learn about your game, tags help Steam determine where
your game should be displayed to customers. We recently began requiring at least 5 tags be applied
to a title before its launch on Steam, but we recommend you add up to 20. In addition to displaying
tag data on store pages, a robust set of tags helps Steam serve better results when users:<br /><br />-
Browse genres &amp; categories<br />- Search with tags<br />- Explore tag-driven recommendations<br />-
Utilize tag-driven dynamic Collections in the Library and more<br /><br />Below is some information
on how tags work and some tools you can use to manage them.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="2"></a>Applying Tags</h2>
Tags can be applied to a game by the developer, by players with non-limited accounts, and by Steam
moderators. This allows the community to help mark up games with the terms, themes, and genres that
help describe the game to others. <br /><br />As the developer of a game, you can define its tags
using the <strong>Steamworks Tag Wizard</strong>, which you'll find in your game's
<i>Store Presence</i> / <i>Edit Store Page</i> / <i>Basic Info</i> section, under <i>Tags</i>. For a
list of titles most in need of tagging, visit your

    >Steamworks Recommended Actions</a
>
page, where you’ll find links to the Tag Wizard per title you manage. <br /><br />This wizard steps
through a series of screens to help you build a well-rounded tag profile for your title. The wizard
also provides an opportunity to order your title's tags for weighting purposes. Many tags can be
applied to your game, but only the top 20 are visible to users and used by Steam to influence
visibility of your title in the store. For more information, refer to the Tags and Store Visibility
section below.<br /><br />Note that tags and their relative weights may change over time as members
of the community apply them to your game. While this tends not to fluctuate over time, you can
revisit your tags and their weights using the Tag Wizard at any time.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="3"></a>Deciding which tags to apply</h2>
Of the hundreds of approved tags on Steam, it can be hard to decide which are most applicable to
your game. We've designed the Tag Wizard to assist you through this process.<br /><br />The Tag
Wizard helps you identify a breadth of relevant tags across Genres, Visuals &amp; View Points,
Themes &amp; Moods, Features, Player support, and more. As the wizard learns about your game, it
highlights tags which may be relevant, based on commonalities found among similar titles on Steam.
The Tag Wizard helps you create a tag profile which includes:<br /><br /><br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        <strong>Genres</strong>, with particular attention to the most specific Genre or
        Sub-Genre<br />
        <ul class="bb_ul">
            <li>
                Example: <i>Super Meat Boy</i> can most specifically be described as a Precision
                Platformer<br />
            </li>
            <li><strong>Super-Genre</strong>: Action <br /></li>
            <li><strong>Genre</strong>: Platformer<br /></li>
            <li><strong>Sub-Genre</strong>: Precision Platformer <br /></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Visual properties</strong>, such as<br />
        <ul class="bb_ul">
            <li><strong>Dimensions</strong>: 2D, 2.5D, 3D<br /></li>
            <li>

            </li>
        </ul>

            <li><strong>Mood</strong>: Relaxing, Funny, Atmospheric, etc.<br /></li>

<br />If you're having trouble deciding which tags make sense, take a look at similar games on Steam
and note the tags applied to those games. You can also browse the list of
<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/tag/browse/#global_492" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
    >popular tags</a
>
to see if any apply to your game, or consult the comprehensive table at the bottom of this document.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="4"></a>Tags and Store Visibility</h2>
The tags associated with your game impact where and how it appears on Steam. Steam uses this
information to figure out which browsing pages your game should appear on and which other games your
game is most like, for recommendation purposes.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="5"></a>Order and weight of tags</h2>
The tags given the most weight govern your visibility more than those given less. Your title's top 5
tags should paint a fairly clear picture of your game as those tags will also be used to describe
your game. Tags are ordered on your game page by the amount of weight each has on your game, as a
result of your own sorting in the Tag Wizard. This can be modified over time as a number of players
apply particular tags to your game. <br /><br />The Tag Wizard helps set these weights with a
Suggest Prioritization feature. This is a very simple algorithm that moves high-information tags
like sub-genres to the top, and redundant or low-information tags (like “indie” or “singleplayer”)
to the bottom. It’s just meant as a simple starting point. It’s not guaranteed to be accurate
because it has no knowledge of what your game is actually like. Feel free to try it as a starting
point, and override it as you see fit.<br /><br />You can also use the display of similarly tagged
titles to help you create a tag profile which places you among comparable titles on Steam. Note that
this is not a direct reflection of the <i>More Like This</i> algorithm's results, but rather, a
strictly tag-driven comparison of title similarity. <br /><br />So, as a recap, start setting tags
and their weight by using the Tag Wizard. Customers will also tag your game and those tags will be
mixed in with the tags you had set with the Tag Wizard. As customers add more tags, the weight for
those tags will increase. You can remove any tags you find unwanted ("family friendly" for a horror
game) or inaccurate ("2D" for a 3D game).
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="6"></a>Tag page visibility</h2>
The top 20 tags on your game determine the tag pages and similar browse views that your game can
appear on.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="7"></a>Recommendations</h2>
Steam offers users a number of different recommendation mechanisms, some of which leverage tags to
determine similarity between titles as an axis for recommendation. <br /><br />Where tags are
applicable, the top 20 tags applied to your game will impact which games Steam thinks are similar to
yours. Here the order is less important than the overlap between multiple tags. So if your game has
"Open World" and "Fantasy", Steam will be more likely to recommend your game to players that have
previously played games tagged with "Open World" and "Fantasy". The more tags that overlap, the
stronger the correlation and recommendation is for that user.<br /><br />Some of Steam's
recommendation algorithms also factor in less-frequently used tags more than really common ones. So
if you have "Action" applied to your game, it matters very little in how your game gets recommended
because so many other games have "Action" applied to them. But if you have something like
"Party-Based RPG" applied to your game, it has much more influence in matching up with other similar
games because there aren't as many games tagged with that term.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="8"></a>The "More Like This" section</h2>
Similar to recommendations, Steam looks at the top 20 tags on your game to figure out which other
game's pages yours should appear (and which other games should appear on your store page as
similar). This is really helpful for players to compare similar games and also to be reassured that
your game is similar to other games they might have enjoyed or are interested in.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="9"></a>Search results and filtering</h2>
You'll also notice when using search within Steam there is a list of tags on the right-hand side
that you can select from to narrow down the results.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="10"></a>Tags and localization</h2>
The tags applied to your game are localized, as they may have different words in different
languages. For example, the top tag on your game may be "RPG" in English, but it's called
"Rollespil" in Danish. The tag order is the same, it's just the translation of the term that changes
based on the language of the user.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="11"></a>Tags and Non-Game Content Types</h2>
The Tag Wizard can be used in association with any game or DLC on Steam. A Demo inherits the tags
associated with its base game.<br /><br />Tags may also be applied to other app types such as
applications, soundtracks, music, tools, videos, etc. with the Steam Store tagging interface,
available on your title's store page.
