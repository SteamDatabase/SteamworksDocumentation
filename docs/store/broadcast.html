<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="2"></a>Broadcasting on Steam</h2>
Steam offers a feature that allows content to be streamed to Steam client and the web store. The
most common example for such content is live game play, others include developer discussion
round-tables, game or developer history documentary among others.<br />
<br />
Streamed content shows up on the game's store page and on the Broadcast hub under the Community
section. If popular, the stream also gets featured on the Home Page.<br />
<br />
Based on partner feedback we received, streaming live game play can offer some benefits. The
developer/publisher is able to<br />
<ul>
    <li>Engage the target audience</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Expand the fan base</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Help existing players explore the full game</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Infuse excitement into the community around updates</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="3"></a>Steam Broadcast Features</h2>

<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="4"></a>How it works</h2>
Streaming to Steam requires the use of streaming and recording programs such as the free software
OBS (Open Broadcaster Software). The performer needs to install OBS on her/his desktop, and either
stream live game play or stream existing video files. The streaming video with audio and overlays
(if any) from the performer's desktop is then either sent directly to Steam client and Web store, or
sent to a multi-streaming provider e.g. Restream.io, where it is forked into multiple streams headed
for different platforms (e.g. Steam, Twitch, YouTube, Facebook, Mixer etc.).<br />
<br />
Here's an illustration on how it works.<br />

<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="5"></a>What you need to get started</h2>
A publisher or developer can get started with broadcasting to Steam with the following.<br />
<ol>
    <li>Create a broadcasting plan and schedule<br /></li>
    <li>
        Create a Restream.io account if you are looking to broadcast to multiple platforms (e.g.
        Twitch, Steam, Mixer, YouTube etc.)<br />
    </li>
    <li>Complete the settings, do a small test stream<br /></li>
    <li>Identify a performer/influencer<br /></li>
    <li>
        Whitelist the Steam account of all performers for each game you would like to stream
        about<br />
    </li>
    <li>Moderate the chat<br /></li>
    <li>Capture feedback (optional but important)</li>
