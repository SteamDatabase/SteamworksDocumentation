<h1>Testing On Steam</h1>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="Overview"></a>Overview</h2>
In order to properly test your application on Steam, you should understand how Steam delivers files
to the user.<br />
<br />
Before getting started you should be familiar with all of the concepts outlined in the
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/application" class="bb_doclink">Applications</a>
documentation.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="internal"></a>Internal Testing Options</h2>
You will obviously need to test your application yourself before release and you may have other
employees that you wish to grant access to help test. The best way to enable these employees to test
is by adding them to your Steamworks account. By default, the first user created in a Steamworks
account is granted administrative permissions and access to the default application being worked on.
That user can then add more users to help develop and test the application. You can read more about
adding new users in
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/gettingstarted/managing_users" class="bb_doclink"
    >Managing Your Steamworks Account</a
>.<br />
<br />
Additionally, you can request keys for a package that will grant immediate access to your
application. To learn more about the different types of packages and requesting keys, please see
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/application/packages" class="bb_doclink"
    >Packages</a
>.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="1"></a>Dev Comp Packages - Important Configuration Note</h2>
As a Steamworks developer, you have a special type of packages attached to your publisher group.
This package is called a Dev Comp Package, and it controls what appIDs and depotIDs your developer
accounts will own automatically when logging into Steam. Just because you have added a new depot to
your application or to your build doesn't mean you can test it. You need to ensure that the new
depotID is listed in your Dev Comp Package or the package you are using to test your game. You can
see the contents of your Dev Comp packages by selecting the application from your Steamworks home
page, selecting the "All Associated Packages, DLC, Demos And Tools" link and then selecting the
package you wish to view the contents of.<br />
<br />
If you are having trouble getting your files to download in Steam, launch "Steam.exe -dev", go to
the Console Tab, and enter the command
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">licenses_for_app &lt;appID&gt;</code> where
&lt;appID&gt; is your appID you are trying to test. This will display the packageID that is being
used to determine what content you own for that appID and it should display the depotIDs in that
package as well. If you are missing depotIDs, you will need to edit the package to include them. For
more information on editing packages, please see

    <a name="external"></a>External Testing Options - Setting up closed or open testing
</h2>
<br />
Setting up pre-release testing is easy and free on Steam, and can be configured to small private
tests or large public tests, or any combination. It’s a great way to get feedback and test the user
experience through Steam, and does not require you to launch the game into Early Access or provide
permanent free access to your testers. These instructions will walk you through providing closed
beta access to your community, and ending the beta when you’re ready. If you’re interested in
releasing a beta version of your game that any customer can buy, check out
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/earlyaccess" class="bb_doclink">Early Access</a>.
<br />
<br />
There are two common ways of setting up testing for external audiences:<br />
<ol class="bb_ol">
    <li>Using the Steam Playtest feature.<br /></li>
    <li>Using the main game's App ID with release override keys.</li>
</ol>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="2"></a>Steam Playtest</h2>
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/features/playtest" class="bb_doclink">Steam Playtest</a>
is a free, low-risk solution to gathering playtest data without the stress of managing email lists
and Steam keys or worrying about user reviews, or wishlists. By using a specific associated appID
that is linked with, but separate from your main game, you can do the playtesting you need without
interfering with your main game.<br />
<br />
Steam Playtest lets you easily gate access to your playtest. You can let in as many or as few
players as you need, and deactivate the playtest app when you wish.<br />
<br />
A Steam Playtest appID has access to the same Steamworks technical features as your main game - but
with reduced store and community setup. Instead of having its own separate store page, your Steam
Playtest signup will live right on your main game, so that customers can sign up and access the
playtest but still Wishlist or Follow the main game.<br />
<br />
Check out the
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/features/playtest" class="bb_doclink">Steam Playtest</a>
documentation for the full set-up instructions, configuration scenarios, best practices and FAQs.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="3"></a>Release Override Keys</h2>
While Steam Playtest is the preferred method of enabling closed betas on Steam, release override
keys are available if you want to manage your playtest off your main game's App ID and have things
like NDAs in place. We recommend the following process for this sort of closed beta.<br />
<ol class="bb_ol">
    <li>
        First, upload a build of your game for your beta testers to play. If you haven't done this
        yet, check out the instructions
        <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/sdk/uploading" class="bb_doclink">here</a> first
        and come back to this page later.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Next, we strongly recommend setting up your
        <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/coming_soon" class="bb_doclink"
            >Coming Soon</a
        >
        page. This provides a reference opportunity to test your marketing presence against the
        experience players are having in game. It also provides the Steam Community Hub as an easy
        place for your community to discuss the game and provide feedback, and makes it easy for
        users to Wishlist your game. <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Request keys from your “Beta Testing” release override package. Any customer who activates
        one of those keys can instantly download and play, so don’t hand them out until you’re
        ready. Take a minute to review the
        <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/features/keys" class="bb_doclink"
            >Steam Key documentation</a
        >
        so you know what the rules are and how the key request process works.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Keep track of the keys you hand out. By default, users who activate a key will own the game
        forever, but if you want to end beta access or revoke the game from beta testers, that’s
        fine too. When you’re ready to end beta access, revoke the keys using the
        <a
            href="https://partner.steamgames.com/partnerbatchbancdkeys/"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noreferrer"
            >key banning tool</a
        >. You can indicate that you’re banning the keys because of the end of a beta, so users get
        a friendly message letting them know they’ve lost access.
    </li>
</ol>
Note: If you’d like to provide a different version of the game to different audiences, that’s easy
to do. For instance, you might have beta testers playing one branch, but provide Press/Influencer
access to a separate branch. Learn more about enabling separate beta branches
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/application/branches" class="bb_doclink">here.</a>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="updates"></a>Testing Updates - Build Branches (Betas)</h2>
If you want to be able to test updates to a game separately from the live version of the game, you
can use build branches to do so. You can assign a particular build to an alternative branch that
users can opt in to via the Steam client. You can also password protect these branches if you wish
to use them only with select individuals or within your own team.<br />
<br />
For more details, please see
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/application/branches" class="bb_doclink"
    >Branches Documentation</a
>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="dlc"></a>Testing DLC</h2>
Testing a DLC is very similar to testing a game. The DLC has an AppID, and that AppID needs to be in
a Dev Comp package that you own (or acquired with a Key) in order to test. Some DLCs contain content
and others are just used as a license check by the game to determine features to unlock. You can
toggle the ownership (license) on and off using the Steam Console (launch Steam.exe -console), and
then using the command <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">enable_license</code>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="4"></a>Adding Friends to Test</h2>
If you need to add brand-new Steam accounts to your friends list in order to test multiplayer
functionality in your game, you will need to take an extra step.<br />
<br />
By default, new accounts are limited in how they can participate in the Steam Community (for more
details, please see
<a
    href="https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=3330-IAGK-7663"
    target="_blank"
    rel="noreferrer"
    >Limited User Accounts</a
>). This will prevent you from sending friend requests from a new Steam account. You can get around
this in one of two ways:<br />
<ol class="bb_ol">
    <li>You can initiate the friend request from a non-limited account.<br /></li>
    <li>
        You can activate a Dev Comp type key for your game on one of the new accounts, which will
        grant the game to that account and will de-limit that account and allow you to send friend
        requests from it.
    </li>
</ol>
