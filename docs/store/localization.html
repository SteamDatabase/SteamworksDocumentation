<h1>Localization and Languages</h1>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Overview</h2>
This guide explains how languages are supported across Steam. Steam is a global platform with full
official support for 29 languages across many platform features. Supporting as many languages,
currencies and payment methods as possible enables Steam to provide the best experience possible to
customers around the world. Over 60% of Steam users use it in a language other than English, so
tailoring your experience for those users is important.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="2"></a>Types of localization</h2>
Steam supports two separate types of localization - store page and in-game. You can use either
independently of each other, but supporting both is ideal.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="store"></a>Managing Store Page Translation</h2>
Steam allows you to localize your store page content, including written description, images, and
trailers. You can enter in copy for multiple languages by clicking the language drop down in the top
right of any text editor inside the Steamworks partner portal.

    <div>
        Tip: If you translate the content on your store page into languages that you are considering
        supporting, you can look at regional wishlists for your game to get a sense of where your
        game might be popular and which languages might warrant higher priority for translation of
        your game.

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="ingame"></a>Managing In-game Translation</h2>
You can also tell customers what language your product supports in-game. There are options for
Subtitles, Interface, or Full Audio for each language.<br />

<i>Example of in-game language options on Steam</i><br />
<br />
If a game supports multiple languages, but the language specific content is small, it isn't
necessary to break the content into distinct depots. The game can instead use a single depot, and
ask Steam for the language that the user has selected by using the
<a href="/doc/api/ISteamApps#GetCurrentGameLanguage">ISteamApps::GetCurrentGameLanguage</a> API.
This will return one of the API language codes listed in
<a href="/doc/store/localization/languages">supported languages</a>. You must set the base languages
that your game supports. You can do that on your
<a href="/apps/depots/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Manage Depots</a> page.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, if your product has a large amount of language specific data, then it's
recommended that you store that data in separate
<a href="/doc/store/application/depots">language specific depots</a>. One additional depot per
language. This way Steam will only deliver the content specific to the language the user is running.
See <a href="/doc/sdk/uploading">Uploading to Steam</a> for more details on how to build language
specific Steam depots.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="localized_app_names"></a>Localized Application Names</h2>
In the General Application Settings of the Steamworks Settings section for your app, you can enter
localized names for your product. Setting a localized name for a language will cause that name to
display to customers who run Steam in that language.<br />
<br />
<img
    src="https://cdn.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/localize_game_name.jpg"
    alt="localize_game_name.jpg"
    title="localize_game_name.jpg"
/><br />
<br />
If you set localized names in the Steamworks Settings section, this will override any name set in
the Store Page section for that language, so that the localized name shown on the Store page will
always match the localized name the customer sees in the library.<br />
<br />
The localized name will be used for search suggestions for customers in that language. The base
(non-localized) name will also be used as a fallback for search suggestions. Additionally, some
legacy applications and APIs may not be language-aware and will show the fallback name.<br />
<br />
Package Names can be localized as well. Select the package you would like to add a localized name
to, click edit package name, then add localized name.<br />
<br />
<strong>Note:</strong> localizing your game name is subject to the same limitations as changing your
game name. Please see: <a href="/doc/store/editing/name">Changing Your Game's Name</a> for more
information.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="3"></a>Localized Community Announcements</h2>
Announcements posted to your Community Hub and Store page can also be localized. <br />
<br />
See the
<a href="/doc/marketing/event_tools#4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
    >Localization section of the Steam Events and Announcements tool</a
>
for more information.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="4"></a>Best Practices</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Prioritize Your Localization Plan</strong> - You shouldn't feel the need to localize
        for every language, nor will every language see the same return on investment. Look at your
        store page traffic, sales, and community feedback to help you make a plan. For an idea of
        language usage across the whole Steam user base, check out the latest
        <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
            >Steam Hardware survey</a
        >
        and select the 'language' row to expand for details.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Release additional languages as an update.</strong> Use the Community Announcements
        and <a href="/doc/marketing/visibility">Update Visibility Round</a> tools to let customers
        know about your new content. You may also consider running a sale if the update is
        significant enough.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>The less a language looks like English, the higher the expected return.</strong>
        Many customers in Asian territories for example do not speak English, while many customers
        in European countries do.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Steam favors products that are localized.</strong> Language support is determined by
        the in-game language settings, not the store page (though if your product is localized, you
        should consider localizing your store page as well).<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Don't confuse language with geography</strong> - Customers on Steam speak different
        languages and their preferences vary independently of their geographic location.
        Additionally, if you have additional languages for your product, you should make them
        available for your entire customer base, not just customers in a specific region.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="5"></a>Achievement Language Support</h2>
You can localize some of your application's achievement names and descriptions. When you query an
achievement string through the API, Steam will return the localized information based on the in game
language the user has selected. You can set up your achievement localization data in the
<a href="/apps/loc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Achievement Localization</a> section of the
App Admin panel.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="6"></a>Gold Master Language Support</h2>
The Gold Master tool can customize the self installing package to the user language. See the
<a href="/doc/sdk/goldmaster#localization">Gold Master Localization</a> documentation for details.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="supported_languages"></a>Supported Languages</h2>

<a href="/doc/store/localization/languages">Languages Supported on Steam</a>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="7"></a>Working With Translation Vendors</h2>
There are many great translation companies around the world that specialize in translating gaming
content. As you consider your options for who to work with for translating your game content, there
are a few things to consider:<br />
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong> Determine your target languages</strong> - Some companies are known to focus or be
        strong with certain regions’ languages than others.<br />
    </li>
    <li><strong>Compare price sheets to know how expensive services are. </strong><br /></li>
    <li>
        <strong>See if you need both localization and localization QA </strong>. For example, if you
        want an unbiased sanity check, you can have one company do the localization and another
        company do the QA. Alternatively, if you have close communication with members of your
        community that speak other languages, you may be able to get feedback directly from your
        players. Think about whether you can set up a way for them to provide you that feedback once
        you start supporting other languages (eg. by setting up a specific sub-forum or other
        discussion area).<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Consider how difficult your game will be to localize</strong>. Is it text heavy/lore
        heavy/easy to relate to globally? This can impact which translation vendor may be better
        suited for particular languages.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong
            >Ask for a deck or list of games that a vendor has worked on and ask them exactly what
            work they did on those games.</strong
        >
        Everyone will list their top clients, but might not specify if they did the game content,
        technical manuals, or even just marketing. Those are all pretty different things, so it’s up
        to you to follow up and get more information so that you can do more research on your own.
