<h1>Applications</h1>
An Application (or App) is the main representation of a product on Steam. An App generally has its
own store page, it's own Community Hub, and is what appears in customers' libraries.<br />
<br />
Each App is represented by a unique ID called an <strong>App ID</strong> - that you'll see
referenced throughout this documentation and used with the
<a href="/doc/sdk/api">Steamworks API</a> and <a href="/doc/webapi_overview">Steamworks Web API</a>.
Generally a single product will not span multiple Applications.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="creating_applications"></a>Creating Applications</h2>
New Applications can be created by any Administrator in your Steamworks partner group. Once the
<a href="/doc/gettingstarted/appfee">Steam Direct Fee</a> for a new Application has been purchased
or you have been granted an app credit, it can be redeemed by clicking "Create new app..." under
"Create A New Application" on the Steamworks landing page.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="types_of_applications"></a>Types of Applications</h2>
The following are the different types of applications that you can create on Steam.<br />
You can set the type of your app on the
<a href="/apps/view" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">General Application Settings</a> section of
the App Admin panel.<br />

                Downloadable Content (DLC) are additional content for your game that can be
                purchased or downloaded for free. They are normally used for soundtracks, artbooks,
                and extra in-game content. This application type will have a separate App ID from
                the base application but will be linked to it. Please see the
                <a href="/doc/store/application/dlc">Downloadable Content (DLC)</a> documentation
                for more information.

                Products such as movies, TV shows, game videos and tutorials will be under these

                Steam has the option to provide free demos for your customers so that they can try
                the game before purchasing. Demos are created through the main App and will appear
                as a button on the main game's store page. This application type will have a
                separate App ID from the base application but will be linked to it. Please see the
                <a href="/doc/store/application/demos">Demos</a> documentation for more information.

The App itself is just one part of the overall content ecosystem on Steam. This section provides a
high level overview of the different pieces that make up an application.<br />

                via Steam or can be granted to users based on the activation of a Steam key. This
                can be thought of as an SKU or a license.

                A branch, or beta, is a specific build that you have made available either publicly
                or privately. Once your title is live, the "Default" branch is the build that is
                delivered to customers. Additional builds can be listed under the beta tab or hidden
                using a password. Password-protected branches are not visible to any account without
                the password.
