<h1>Applications</h1>
An Application (or App) is the main representation of a product on Steam. An App generally has its
own store page, it's own Community Hub, and is what appears in customers' libraries.<br />
<br />
Each App is represented by a unique ID called an <strong>App ID</strong> - that you'll see
referenced throughout this documentation and used with the
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/sdk/api" class="bb_doclink">Steamworks API</a> and
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/webapi_overview" class="bb_doclink"
    >Steamworks Web API</a
>. Generally a single product will not span multiple Applications.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="creating_applications"></a>Creating Applications</h2>
New Applications can be created by any Administrator in your Steamworks partner group. Once the
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/gettingstarted/appfee" class="bb_doclink"
    >Steam Direct Fee</a
>
for a new Application has been purchased or you have been granted an app credit, it can be redeemed
by clicking "Create new app..." under "Create A New Application" on the Steamworks landing page.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="types_of_applications"></a>Types of Applications</h2>
The following are the different types of applications that you can create on Steam.<br />
You can set the type of your app on the

            content. This application type will have a separate App ID from the base application but
            will be linked to it. Please see the

            Steam has the option to provide free demos for your customers so that they can try the

            button on the main game's store page. This application type will have a separate App ID
            from the base application but will be linked to it. Please see the

            A branch, or beta, is a specific build that you have made available either publicly or
            privately. Once your title is live, the "Default" branch is the build that is delivered
            to customers. Additional builds can be listed under the beta tab or hidden using a
            password. Password-protected branches are not visible to any account without the
            password.
