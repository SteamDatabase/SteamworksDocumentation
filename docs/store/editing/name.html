<h1>Changing Your Game's Name</h1>
You can change the name of your game within Steamworks at any time until your store page has been
through the pre-release review process.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="1"></a>Where your game's name is defined</h2>
Your game's name is defined in three main locations:<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        <strong>Store info</strong> - On the "Basic Info" tab under "Edit Store". This name is used
        within the Steam store, including search results.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Steamworks Info</strong> - On the "General Application Settings" tab under
        Steamworks Settings. This name is used within the Steam library and the Steam Community.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Package Info</strong> - Each store package that sells your game. This is used to
        present your purchase option shown on your store page and during the checkout process.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="2"></a>Localizing your game's name</h2>
