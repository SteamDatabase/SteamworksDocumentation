<h1>Developer And Publisher Homepages</h1>
Developers and publishers can create a customized homepage page for their organization to display
all the games made or published by that organization. There are a variety of ways to customize your
homepage, and you'll be able to link all your individual games to your homepage. (you can also
create franchise-specific pages. Please see
<a href="/doc/store/franchise_pages">Franchise Pages Documentation</a> for more information.)<br />

<br />
Once your page is set up, players can then 'follow' your organization to be notified when you
release your next title.<br />
<br />
This page explains the process and details for setting up and customizing your homepage.<br />

        Once you have assigned a custom URL, it is associated with that particular community group.

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Required permissions</h2>
We first need to make sure your Steam account can access these features.<br />
<ol>
    <li>
        Make sure your Steam account is part of the Steamworks developer account with 'Edit App
        Marketing Data' permissions. You should see the name of your company up near the Steamworks
        logo at the top of this page.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        You'll need to make sure that your individual Steam account is not 'limited'. If your own
        account is limited, you won't be able to create community groups or request to join an
        existing group. Click
        <a

        >
        for details on limited accounts.
    </li>
</ol>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="2"></a>Setting up</h2>
You'll need to do a couple of things to first set up your page, after which it will mostly operate
by itself. To get started:<br />
<ol>
    <li>
        <strong>Create or select a Steam Community group</strong> - Developer/Publisher home pages
        are built on a community group, which is useful for managing permissions and access. So the
        first step is to
        <a href="http://www.steamcommunity.com/actions/GroupCreate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
            >Create a Community Group</a
        >
        with the name of your company. You'll probably also want to upload an avatar image to the
        group for your company logo. <br />
        <ul>
            <li>
                Note that the name of your group will be used as the name at the top of your Creator
                Homepage. <br />
            </li>
            <li>
                The URL associated with your community group will not be used for your Creator
                Homepage. You'll setup an entirely different URL once you've started the Creator
                specific setup (see the URL section below for more details).<br />
            </li>
            <li>
                If you already have a group you wish you use, make sure your Steam account is set as
                the group owner or has 'officer' rank within that group by visiting the group page
                and note whether you see a set of 'admin tools' in the right-hand column. You can
                also use a group that was previously set up as a curator and posted game reviews.
                Just follow the rest of the steps to upgrade that group to become your Creator
                Homepage. Any games you previously reviewed will still be listed and available.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Associate your games</strong> - There are two ways to link your games with this new
        homepage.<br />
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Bulk linking:</strong> Navigate to the
                <a href="/creatorhome/setup" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
                    >Creator Homepage Setup</a
                >
                which will list out all the apps you have 'Edit App Marketing Data' permission for.
                Select which developer and/or publisher names you want to associate with your new
                homepage by selecting the group from the drop-down for each name. Once you've done
                this and hit 'save', you can go to your Creator Homepage (follow the developer or
                publisher link from one of your store pages) and your page will now be grey instead
                of blue.<br />
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Individual linking:</strong> Navigate to the 'edit store' page for your
                game. On the 'Basic Info' tab, you'll see the fields where the developer and
                publisher of your game are named. Click the 'link' button next to each, and select
                your homepage group from the options in the pop-up window.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Customize your new Creator Homepage</strong> - You can then go to your new Creator
        Homepage and customize it, adding a logo, background image, picking which titles to feature,
        creating lists, etc. See below for more details on customization.
    </li>
</ol>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="3"></a>Customizing your Creator Homepage</h2>
Once you go through the initial setup, your new page can be customized in a number of ways to
highlight the games that you want to show off and to make it easier to find full franchises of
games.<br />
<strong>To access the administrative panel for your page</strong>, simply visit your page in the
Steam store by clicking on the 'developer' or 'publisher' field. You should then see an
'<strong>ADMIN</strong>' link on your new page where you can manage the layout of your page and
create lists.<br />
<br />
<img

    alt="ADMINbutton_1.PNG"
    title="ADMINbutton_1.PNG"
/><br />
<br />
<strong>Note:</strong> The creator home is built-on top of Steam Curator technology and re-uses the
curators existing permissions model. Your group membership level needs to have '...manage page admin
settings and review games?' to access the 'Admin Tab'. For example, the default setting, will allow
the owner and any member promoted to officer to be able to access the review tab.<br />
<br />
<img

    title="2020-01-16_6-50-16.png"
/>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="4"></a>Customization</h2>
You can customize your page in a few different ways:<br />
<ol>
    <li>
        <strong>Featured games</strong> - On your Creator Homepage, you have five individual
        sections that can be customized with various options for format and contents. For example,
        you can select a 'New Releases' section to appear first on your page, followed by a row of
        'Action Games'. You can even have a row of discounts automatically appear when you are
        running a promotion.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Background image</strong> - You can upload a custom background image for the top
        area of your page to more strongly brand your presence. For best results, use an image that
        is 1500px wide and 261px tall.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Tags</strong> - There is automatically a 'browse' section on your page that lists
        all your titles. You can select the list of tags that can be used to filter that list,
        depending on the tags that make most sense for your catalog. For example, if you primarily
        develop racing games, you can select racing subgenres as the useful set of tags to filter
        your games by.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Lists</strong> - You can create lists of games by franchise or other logical
        grouping. These can then be featured on your page or used as promotional pages if you wish
        to point customers to a particular set of titles.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Custom URL</strong> - You can define a friendly URL that your page can be listed
        under within Steam. See below for more details.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Social media links</strong> - You can link your social media accounts to make it
        easy for fans to find your Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Twitch accounts, or your own
        website.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Post Announcements</strong> - You can also post announcements to appear on your
        Creator Homepage as well as in the activity feed of any followers.<br />
    </li>
    <li>And more to come...</li>
</ol>
To see all customization options, please visit the administrative panel for your creator page.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="customurl"></a>Custom page URL</h2>
A custom page URL is a short name that helps your fans find your home page with an official URL on
the Steam store. For example:
<a href="http://www.steampowered.com/developer/valve" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
    >www.steampowered.com/developer/valve</a
>.<br />
Once you have specified and saved a page URL, you can use a few different URLs to get to your page,
depending on your company and your preference:<br />
<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="http://www.steampowered.com/publisher/valve" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
            >www.steampowered.com/publisher/valve</a
        ><br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="http://www.steampowered.com/pub/valve" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
            >www.steampowered.com/pub/valve</a
        ><br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="http://www.steampowered.com/developer/valve" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
            >www.steampowered.com/developer/valve</a
        ><br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="http://www.steampowered.com/dev/valve" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
            >www.steampowered.com/dev/valve</a
        >
    </li>
</ul>
Note: You should not misrepresent your company or use the name or trademark of a different company.
Your choice of custom URL will be deemed a “Company Mark” under the Steam Distribution Agreement, so
it should be original and not infringing on anyone else’s rights.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="5"></a>Creating Lists</h2>
Within your Creator Homepage, you can create lists for organizing groups of your games together.
These can be long-term lists for organizing all the titles in a franchise, or can be used for
temporary purposes such as listing out the titles you are running a promotion on.<br />
<br />
To create a list, simply visit the admin panel for your Creator Page and select 'Create a list' from
the left column. You can then give your list a name and description, select the format of your list,
and select the titles to display in your list.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="6"></a>Releasing new games</h2>
New games, demos, soundtracks, or DLC you are working on releasing will each need to be linked to
your Creator Homepage, and are best done prior to release of the new game's store page.<br />
<ol>
    <li>
        When creating the store page for a new title, you'll need to specify the 'developer',
        'publisher', and optionally the 'franchise' fields. Steam will show you an auto-complete
        option of previous developer and publisher names you've entered.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Once those are entered and you've saved the page, you'll see a new 'link' button appear next
        to each.<br />
    </li>
    <li>Click the 'link' button and select your group from the pop-up options.</li>
</ol>
Once your store page has been approved and you set it live as 'coming soon', your new game will
automatically appear on the linked homepages. Once you release your game, it will automatically
appear as a new release on the linked pages, and players who follow those pages will get an email
notification about the release.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="announcements"></a>Posting Announcements</h2>
Once your Creator Homepage is set up, you have a few ways to reach your fans. You can post an
announcement in your group, which you can also choose to have show up on your Creator Homepage. When
posting an announcement from Creator Homepage, you can pick to have it appear on your homepage. This
will allow the announcement to be listed on your page as well as in the activity feed of players
that have followed your homepage.<br />
<br />
We will show up to three announcements on the top your homepage with a link to read the rest of
them. Here is an example what this would look like:<br />
<br />
<img
    src="https://cdn.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/PublisherHomePageAnnouncementExample.png"
    alt="PublisherHomePageAnnouncementExample.png"
    title="PublisherHomePageAnnouncementExample.png"
/>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="broadcast"></a>Broadcasting to Your Page</h2>
You can configure Creator home page to receive live broadcast. This can be enabled on the settings
page of your admin panel (Admin-&gt;Edit Creator Settings). This option is near the bottom with the
section title broadcast settings. By default this feature is disabled.<br />
<br />
<img
    src="https://cdn.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/2018-09-13_13-02-59.png"
    alt="2018-09-13_13-02-59.png"
    title="2018-09-13_13-02-59.png"
/><br />
<br />
This will permit members of the Creator home's community group with the appropriate role (owner or
officer or moderator) to automatically broadcast onto the publisher page. You can edit the role
which is allowed by going to the 'group permissions page' in Steam community. By default, the
broadcast permissions are set to the owner of the group. <br />
<br />
<img
    src="https://cdn.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/2018-09-13_13-09-57.png"
    alt="2018-09-13_13-09-57.png"
    title="2018-09-13_13-09-57.png"
/><br />
<br />
NOTE: We currently only show a single broadcast on the publisher page chosen based on the highest
viewership of the available broadcasts.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="Franchise"></a>Franchise Pages</h2>
These pages are similar in their setup to a developer or publisher page, except that they will pull
their names from the franchise field. The franchise field is a recent addition to your store page
setting. You can update the franchise fields for your games by going to
<a href="/apps/landing/<app" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
    >https://partner.steamgames.com/apps/landing/&lt;app</a
>
id&gt; and choosing Edit Store Page-&gt;Basic Info tab. The franchise information needs only to be
entered in the primary game, any DLC will automatically inherit their parent apps franchises.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="customers"></a>What customers see?</h2>
When a Steam customer follows your homepage, they are giving Steam a strong signal that they enjoy
your content. Which lets Steam find ways to keep them informed on your major updates. It gives Steam
permission to then enhance the following customers store experience by the following ways:<br />
<br />
<ul>
    <li>
        They will receive an email when your game launches or enters early access or exits early
        access. For example: <br />
        <br />
        <img
            src="https://cdn.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/NewReleaseLaunchEmail.png"
            alt="New Release Launch Emails example"
            title="New Release Launch Emails example"
        /><br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        When they are browsing either the Steam front page or a genre and/or tag Steam hub page, we
        will mix in your recently released games into their main capsules. We will also remind them
        why we are showing them the capsule.<br />
        <br />
        <img
            src="https://cdn.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/HubFollowDigitalExtremes.png"
            alt="Recent Release on a Hub"
            title="Recent Release on a Hub"
        /><br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        The Steam front page may have a section that highlights Developers, Publishers or Franchises
        that would be of interest to individual Steam users.<br />
        <br />
        <img
            src="https://cdn.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/fromyouknow.PNG"
            alt="fromyouknow.PNG"
            title="fromyouknow.PNG"
        />
        <br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        The individual product page will highlight that they follow your page as a reason why this
        game is relevant to them. <br />
        <br />
        <img

</ul>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="faq"></a>FAQ</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        <h4>Q: Can I link more than one developer or publisher?</h4>
        A: Yes, you can enter multiple developers and multiple publishers. For each one, you can
        specify the same page or a different page that the name should link to. Remember, you can
        only link to a Creator Homepage that you are in control of or have linked to previously. If
        your game is published by a different company, that publisher may have to link the game to
        their Creator Homepage themselves.<br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Q: Can I link different developer or publisher names to the same Creator Homepage?</h4>
        A: Yes. This might be useful if you have multiple game studios that you present as a single
        brand.<br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Q: Do I need to do anything special to add new releases to my page?</h4>
        A: When creating the store page for your new game, you will have entered the developer and
        publisher names already. In that step, you might have already selected the Creator Homepage
        to link to. If you initially created your store page a long time ago, you may need to fix up
        some outliers, but most of those cases should have already been handled when you used the
        <a href="/creatorhome/setup" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Creator Page Setup</a> tool.
        (Note: you can use this tool again at any time to make sure your set of names and linked
        pages is up to date and complete.)<br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Q: Does my group have to be public?</h4>
        A: Your group itself can be public or private. That's up to you. You'll use some of the
        group features for things like posting announcements or managing who has access to edit and
        customize your Creator Homepage. The members you invite or allow to join your community
        group are separate from users who choose to follow your Creator Homepage. Membership in the
        group itself is useful if you want to have a place to have conversation with players.<br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Q: What if the group name or URL that I want is not available?</h4>
        A: In the event that another group is misrepresenting your company or using your name or
        trademark, please contact our support. Add a brief description of the issue, along with the
        name, URL, or abbreviation that isn’t available. Make sure to login with a Steam account
        that has access to Steamworks so that you can successfully access this link:
        <a
            href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/wizard/HelpWithPublishing?issueid=905"

            rel="noreferrer"
            >Contact Support</a
        ><br />
        We look at several different factors when reviewing these requests, including group
        activity, ownership, and misrepresentation. We’re often able to find a workaround, but there
        are also times when freeing up the name doesn’t make sense. In those cases, we would ask
        that you use something different.<br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Q: What if I can't find a product on my creator page?</h4>
        A: If a product is not being associated with your creator homepage, it's likely one of two
        problems. First, check to make sure you have 'Edit App Marketing Data' priveleges for the
        product in question. Second, if you released this product after setting up your creator
        homepage, you'll need to complete the linking process again here:
        <a href="/creatorhome/setup" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Creator Homepage Setup</a
        ><br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Q: Can I remove an app from my Franchise or Developer Homepage?</h4>
        A: Yes. Under the admin section of your creator home, choose 'Edit App Details' from the
        left column, click the button 'Choose Product' to search for the game by name or AppID. Once
        the game is loaded, on the bottom right of this page is the button to 'Unlink app from
        Creator Home'. This can be used to remove the app from appearing your home page and from all
        of the custom list you have built. <br />
        <br />
        Note: This action may take a little while to execute and may take a little while longer for
        all the Steam web servers to reflect the changes. When you remove an app, that action should
        appear on your creator home within 10-20 minutes.<br />
        <br />
        This will not alter the publisher/developer/franchise names associated with the app. That
        needs to be updated on the Steamworks partner site by editing the store page for the app.<br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>
            Q: What happens to a game appearing on a Developer or Publisher Homepage when it's been
            transferred?
        </h4>
        A: When a
        <a href="/doc/gettingstarted/managing_apps/transfer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
            >transfer is initiated for an AppID</a
        >, the AppID will automatically be removed from all Developer or Publisher Homepages that it
        is currently listed on. Once the transfer is complete, the AppID can be listed on the new
        Developer/Publisher Homepage. If it's not showing up, you may need to refresh the page by
        going to your creator page &gt; admin tab &gt; edit app details &gt; and then select the
        product.
