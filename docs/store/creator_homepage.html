<h1>Developer And Publisher Homepages</h1>
Steam now has the tools for developers and publishers to create a customized homepage page for their
organization and to display all the games made or published by that organization. There are a
variety of ways you can customize your homepage, and you'll be able to link all your individual
games to your homepage. (you can also create franchise-specific pages. Please see
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/franchise_pages" class="bb_doclink"
    >Franchise Pages Documentation</a
>
for more information.)<br /><br /><a

when you release your next title.<br /><br />This page explains the process and details for setting
up and customizing your homepage.<br /><br /><img

        <h3>Feature Currently in Open Beta</h3>
        This feature is currently in an open beta, which means we're still working on it, but it's
        open to all developers and publishers and visible to players.
    </div>

<br /><strong>Known issues and work in progress:</strong><br />These are the bigger issues that we
are currently aware of. If you encounter others, please give us feedback or ask questions in the
beta group here:

        Do not drop a community group that you assigned a custom page URL as it will continue to
        belong to the dropped community group.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Newly added games do not automatically add to your creator home page. You need to redo
        'Associate your games' in the 'Setting Up' section below for each new game you add. We are
        looking to make this automatic in the future. <br />

    </li>
</ol>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="2"></a>Before you start</h2>
We first need to make sure your Steam account can access these features.<br />
<ol class="bb_ol ">
    <li>
        Make sure your Steam account is part of the Steamworks developer account with 'Edit App
        Marketing Data' permissions. You should see the name of your company up near the Steamworks
        logo at the top of this page.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        You'll need to make sure that your individual Steam account is not 'limited'. If your own
        account is limited, you won't be able to create community groups or request to join an
        existing group. Click
        <a
            href="https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=3330-IAGK-7663"

            rel="noreferrer"
            >here</a
        >
        for details on limited accounts.
    </li>
</ol>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="3"></a>Setting up</h2>
You'll need to do a couple of things to first set up your page, after which it will mostly operate
by itself. To get started:<br />
<ol class="bb_ol ">
    <li>
        <strong>Create or select a community group</strong> - Developer/Publisher home pages are
        built on a community group, which is useful for managing permissions and access. So the
        first step is to
        <a href="http://www.steamcommunity.com/actions/GroupCreate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
            >Create a Community Group</a
        >
        with the name of your company. You'll probably also want to upload an avatar image to the
        group for your company logo. <br />
        <ul class="bb_ul ">
            <li>
                Note that the name of your group will be used as the name at the top of your Creator
                Homepage. <br />
            </li>
            <li>
                The URL associated with your community group will not be used for your Creator
                Homepage. You'll setup an entirely different URL once you've started the Creator
                specific setup (see the URL section below for more details).<br />
            </li>
            <li>
                If you already have a group you wish you use, make sure you are an owner or officer
                within that group by visiting the group page and note whether you see a set of
                'admin tools' in the right-hand column. If you want to use a group that was
                previously set up as a curator and posted game reviews, you can. Just follow the
                rest of the steps to upgrade that group to become your Creator Homepage. Any games
                you previously reviewed will still be listed and available.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Associate your games</strong> - Now we need to go through a quick process to link
        the developer and publisher names shown on your store pages to this new creator homepage.
        Navigate to the
        <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/creatorhome/setup" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
            >Creator Homepage Setup</a
        >
        which will list out all the apps you have 'Edit App Marketing Data' permission for. Select
        which developer and/or publisher names you want to associate with your new homepage by
        selecting the group from the drop-down for each name. Once you've done this and hit 'save',
        you can go to your Creator Homepage (follow the developer or publisher link from one of your
        store pages) and your page will now be grey instead of blue.<br />Keep in mind that if you
        create a new app on Steam after creating your homepage, you will need to complete this
        process again in order for that app to be associated with your creator homepage.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Customize your new Creator Homepage</strong> - You can then go to your new Creator
        Homepage and customize it, adding a logo, background image, picking which titles to feature,
        creating lists. etc. See below for more details on customization.
    </li>
</ol>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="4"></a>Customizing your Creator Homepage</h2>
Once you go through the initial setup, your new page can be customized in a number of ways to
highlight the games that you want to show off and to make it easier to find full franchises of
games.<br /><br /><strong>To access the administrative panel for your page</strong>, simply visit
your page in the Steam store by clicking on the 'developer' or 'publisher' field. You should then
see an 'admin' link on your new page where you can manage the layout of your page and create
lists.<br /><br /><strong>Note:</strong> The creator home is built-on top of Steam Curator
technology and re-uses the curators existing permissions model. Your group membership level needs to
have '...manage page admin settings and review games?' to access the 'Admin Tab'. For example, the
default setting, will allow the owner and any member promoted to officer to be able to access the
review tab.<br /><br /><img

    title="2020-01-16_6-50-16.png"
/>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="5"></a>Customization</h2>
You can customize your page in a few different ways:<br />
<ol class="bb_ol ">
    <li>
        <strong>Featured games</strong> - On your Creator Homepage, you have five individual
        sections that can be customized with various options for format and contents. For example,
        you can select a 'New Releases' section to appear first on your page, followed by a row of
        'Action Games'. You can even have a row of discounts automatically appear when you are
        running a promotion.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Background image</strong> - You can upload a custom background image for the top
        area of your page to more strongly brand your presence. For best results, use an image that
        is 1500px wide and 261px tall.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Tags</strong> - There is automatically a 'browse' section on your page that lists
        all your titles. You can select the list of tags that can be used to filter that list,
        depending on the tags that make most sense for your catalog. For example, if you primarily
        develop racing games, you can select racing subgenres as the useful set of tags to filter
        your games by.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Lists</strong> - You can create lists of games by franchise or other logical
        grouping. These can then be featured on your page or used as promotional pages if you wish
        to point customers to a particular set of titles.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Custom URL</strong> - You can define a friendly URL that your page can be listed
        under within Steam. See below for more details.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Social media links</strong> - You can link your social media accounts to make it
        easy for fans to find your Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Twitch accounts, or your own
        website.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Google Analytics</strong> - You can enter your own Google Analytics code so you can
        track visits to your page and visits to the lists that you may create.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Post Announcements</strong> - You can also post announcements to appear on your
        Creator Homepage as well as in the activity feed of any followers.<br />
    </li>
    <li>And more to come...</li>
</ol>
To see all customization options, please visit the administrative panel for your creator page.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="customurl"></a>Custom page URL</h2>
A custom page URL is an short name that helps your fans find your home page with an official URL on
the Steam store such. For example:
<a href="http://www.steampowered.com/developer/valve" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
    >www.steampowered.com/developer/valve</a
>.<br />Once you have specified and saved a page URL, you can use a few different URLs to get to
your page, depending on your company and your preference:<br />
<ul class="bb_ul ">
    <li>
        <a href="http://www.steampowered.com/publisher/valve" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
            >www.steampowered.com/publisher/valve</a
        ><br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="http://www.steampowered.com/pub/valve" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
            >www.steampowered.com/pub/valve</a
        ><br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="http://www.steampowered.com/developer/valve" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
            >www.steampowered.com/developer/valve</a
        ><br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="http://www.steampowered.com/dev/valve" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
            >www.steampowered.com/dev/valve</a
        >
    </li>
</ul>
Note: You should not misrepresent your company or use the name or trademark of a different company.
Your choice of custom URL will be deemed a “Company Mark” under the Steam Distribution Agreement, so
it should be original and not infringing on anyone else’s rights.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="6"></a>Creating Lists</h2>
Within your Creator Homepage, you can create lists for organizing groups of your games together.
These can be long-term lists for organizing all the titles in a franchise, or can be used for
temporary purposes such as listing out the titles you are running a promotion on.<br /><br />To
create a list, simply visit the admin panel for your Creator Page and select 'Create a list' from
the left column. You can then give your list a name and description, select the format of your list,
and select the titles to display in your list.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="7"></a>Releasing new games</h2>
<div class="bb_callout bb_red">
    <div>
        <strong>NOTE</strong>: Automatic linking is not yet complete. In the meantime, if you are
        setting up a new store page, please make sure you go to your
        <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/creatorhome/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
            >Homepage Setup Admin</a
        >
        and link your new game there before release.
    </div>
</div>
New games will automatically get added to any linked Creator Homepages, provided that you confirm
the link as part of creating the store page of the new game.
<br /><br />When creating the store page for a new title, you'll need to specify the 'developer' and
'publisher' fields. If you enter a developer or publisher name that you have previously linked with
your page, we'll automatically set the link between this usage and your page.<br /><br />Once your
store page has been approved and you set it live as 'coming soon', your new game will automatically
get added to the linked pages. Once you release your game, it will automatically appear as a new
release on the linked pages.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="announcements"></a>Posting Announcements</h2>
Once your Creator Homepage is set up, you have a few ways to reach your fans. You can post an
announcement in your group, which you can also choose to have show up on your Creator Homepage as
well as optionally posted to a list of games.<br />
<ul class="bb_ul ">
    <li>
        <strong>Posting to Creator Homepage</strong> - When posting an announcement from Creator
        Homepage, you can pick to have it appear on your homepage. This will allow the announcement
        to be listed on your page as well as in the activity feed of players that have followed your
        homepage.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Posting to list of apps</strong> - When posting an announcement from within your
        Creator Homepage, you can choose to have that announcement posted to all the games on a list
        that you have created. When you choose this option and select a list, the announcement will
        then appear on the store page for each app in that list, as well as in the activity feed for
        players that follow any of those apps. These announcements will also appear in the 'news'
        section for each of the apps on that selected list.
    </li>
</ul>
<br />We will show up to three announcements on the top your homepage with a link to read the rest
of them. Here is example what this would look like:<br /><br /><img
    src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/PublisherHomePageAnnouncementExample.png"
    alt="PublisherHomePageAnnouncementExample.png"
    title="PublisherHomePageAnnouncementExample.png"
/>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="broadcast"></a>Broadcasting to Your Page</h2>
You can configure Creator home page to receive live broadcast. This can be enabled on the settings
page of your admin panel (Admin-&gt;Edit Creator Settings). This option is near the bottom with the
section title broadcast settings. By default this feature is disabled.<br /><br /><img
    src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/2018-09-13_13-02-59.png"
    alt="2018-09-13_13-02-59.png"
    title="2018-09-13_13-02-59.png"
/><br /><br />This will permit members of the Creator home's community group with the appropriate
role (owner or officer or moderator) to automatically broadcast onto the publisher page. You can
edit the role which is allowed by going to the 'group permissions page' in Steam community. By
default, the broadcast permissions are set to the owner of the group. <br /><br /><img
    src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/2018-09-13_13-09-57.png"
    alt="2018-09-13_13-09-57.png"
    title="2018-09-13_13-09-57.png"
/><br /><br />NOTE: We currently only show a single broadcast on the publisher page chosen based on
the highest viewership of the available broadcasts.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="Franchise"></a>Franchise Pages</h2>
These pages are similar in their setup to a developer or publisher page, except that they will pull
their names from the franchise field. The franchise field is a recent addition to your store page
setting. You can update the franchise fields for your games by going to
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/apps/landing/&lt;app" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
    >https://partner.steamgames.com/apps/landing/&lt;app</a
>
id&gt; and choosing Edit Store Page-&gt;Basic Info tab. The franchise information needs only to be
entered in the primary game, any DLC will automatically inherit their parent apps franchises.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="customers"></a>What customers see?</h2>
When a Steam customer follows your homepage, they are giving Steam a strong signal that they enjoy
your content. Which lets Steam find ways to keep them informed on your major updates. It gives Steam
permission to then enhance the following customers store experience by the following ways:<br /><br />
<ul class="bb_ul ">
    <li>
        They will receive an email when your game launches or enters early access or exits early
        access. For example: <br /><br /><img
            src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/NewReleaseLaunchEmail.png"
            alt="New Release Launch Emails example"
            title="New Release Launch Emails example"
        /><br /><br />
    </li>
    <li>
        When they are browsing either the Steam front page or a genre and/or tag Steam hub page, we
        will mix in your recently released games into their main capsules. We will also remind them
        why we are showing them the capsule.<br /><br /><img
            src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/HubFollowDigitalExtremes.png"
            alt="Recent Release on a Hub"
            title="Recent Release on a Hub"
        /><br /><br />
    </li>
    <li>
        The individual product page will highlight that they follow your page as a reason why this
        game is relevant to them. <br /><br /><img
            src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/PublishedBySomeoneYouFollow.png"
            alt="Publisher your follow"
            title="Publisher your follow"
        />
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="faq"></a>FAQ</h2>
<ul class="bb_ul ">
    <li>
        <h4>Can I link more than one developer or publisher?</h4>
        Yes, you can enter multiple developers and multiple publishers. For each one, you can
        specify the same page or a different page that the name should link to. Remember, you can
        only link to a Creator Homepage that you are in control of or have linked to previously. If
        your game is published by a different company, that publisher may have to link the game to
        their Creator Homepage themselves.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Can I link different developer or publisher names to the same Creator Homepage?</h4>
        Yes. This might be useful if you have multiple game studios that you present as a single
        brand.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Do I need to do anything special to add new releases to my page?</h4>
        When creating the store page for your new game, you will have entered the developer and
        publisher names already. In that step, you might have already selected the Creator Homepage
        to link to. If you initially created your store page a long time ago, you may need to fix up
        some outliers, but most of those cases should have already been handled when you used the
        <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/creatorhome/setup" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
            >Creator Page Setup</a
        >
        tool. (Note: you can use this tool again at any time to make sure your set of names and
        linked pages is up to date and complete.)<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Does my group have to be public?</h4>
        Your group itself can be public or private. That's up to you. You'll use some of the group
        features for things like posting announcements or managing who has access to edit and
        customize your Creator Homepage.<br />The members you invite or allow to join your community
        group are separate from users who choose to follow your Creator Homepage. Membership in the
        group itself is useful if you want to have a place to have conversation with players.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>What if the group name or URL that I want is not available?</h4>
        In the event that another group is misrepresenting your company or using your name or
        trademark, please contact our support. Add a brief description of the issue, along with the
        name, URL, or abbreviation that isn’t available. Make sure to login with a Steam account
        that has access to Steamworks so that you can successfully access this link:<br /><a
            href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/wizard/HelpWithPublishing?issueid=905"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noreferrer"
            >Contact Support</a
        ><br />We look at several different factors when reviewing these requests, including group
        activity, ownership, and misrepresentation. We’re often able to find a workaround, but there
        are also times when freeing up the name doesn’t make sense. In those cases, we would ask
        that you use something different.<br /><br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>What if I can't find a product on my creator page?</h4>
        If a product is not being associated with your creator homepage, it's likely one of two
        problems. First, check to make sure you have 'Edit App Marketing Data' priveleges for the
        product in question. Second, if you released this product after setting up your creator
        homepage, you'll need to complete the linking process again here:<br /><a
            href="https://partner.steamgames.com/creatorhome/setup"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noreferrer"

        ><br />
    </li>
</ul>
<ul class="bb_ul %1$s">
    <li>
        <h4>Can I remove an app from my Franchise or Developer Homepage?</h4>
        Yes. Under the admin section of your creator home, choose 'Edit App Details' from the left
        column, click the button 'Choose Product' to search for the game by name or appid. Once the
        game is loaded, on the bottom right of this page is the button to 'Unlink app from Creator
        Home'. This can be used to remove the app from appearing your home page and from all of the
        custom list you have built. <br /><br />Note this action may take a little while to execute
        and may take a little while longer for all the Steam web servers to reflect the changes. The
        remove app should removed from your creator home within 10-20 minutes.<br /><br />This will
        not alter the publisher/developer/franchise names associated with the app. That needs to be
        updated on the Steamworks partner site by editing the store page for the app.
    </li>
</ul>
