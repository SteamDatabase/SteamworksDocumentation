<h1>Manage Editions</h1>
Many games have additional content like soundtracks or bonus content that may or may not be sold
separately. This additional content can be grouped with the game itself and sold together. In the
vast majority of scenarios, it benefits the player to sell this content as a
<a

    target="_blank"
    rel="noreferrer"
    >Complete the Set bundle</a
>
so that they can buy just the content that they don’t already own.<br />
<br />
In some cases, a new store
<a
    href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/application/packages"
    target="_blank"
    rel="noreferrer"
    >package</a
>
may be created as a new purchase option. The Manage Editions tool is only available for packages at
this time.<br />
<br />
If your game has multiple store packages, a Manage Editions button will automatically appear on your
app landing page. Using the Manage Editions button, you can select which packages are editions of
your game, present those editions as top purchase options on your store page (sorted by price,
lowest to highest), and also upload a localized image that helps customers compare the various
editions.<br />
<br />
To use this feature, navigate to your game’s App Landing Page and click on Manage Editions.
Reminder: the Manage Editions button will ONLY appear for apps that have more than one package.<br />

<br />
From here, you can select which packages represent editions of your game.<br />

<br />
Click the boxes to select editions of your game. By doing so, these packages will be displayed above
other purchase options on your page that don’t contain the base game. Note: by default, only
packages that contain the base game can appear on a game’s store page, but there are rare
exceptions. By selecting the packages that are editions of your game using Manage Editions, you can
ensure they will appear above any other purchase options on your store page.<br />
<br />
At the bottom, you can upload an image to help customers compare editions.<br />
<br />
Simply drag an image (748px x 896px) that compares the various editions of your game. These images
help customers understand what content is included in each edition and which purchase option is
right for them. <u>Important</u>: you can upload a localized image for all supported languages.
Uploading localized assets is a critical step, as it helps customers around the world understand the
purchase options you are presenting to them.<br />

<br />
Once you have managed your editions and uploaded a comparison image, click “Save” to save any
changes you have made.
<strong>You must publish your store page before they will be visible to users.</strong> Please be
sure to review the comparison image guidelines and best practices below.<br />
<br />
A new "Compare Editions" option will appear on your store page that customers can use to quickly and
easily see the differences between the various editions of your game. The Compare Editions asset is
much easier for customers to find than having to scroll down and search through the store page for
this information.<br />

<br />
In addition, partners have the ability to display capsule art underneath the purchase option of a
given edition on your store page. To enable this, click on any package for your game on your app
landing page and scroll down to "Display". Here, you will see a checkbox you can select that enables
this option.<br />

<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="1"></a>Compare Editions Asset Guidelines</h2>
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>Be sure to upload localized versions of the asset.<br /></li>
    <li>
        Avoid including information like Release date and pre-purchase messaging in your edition
        comparison asset. There are more appropriate spots on Steam to show this information and
        this information can quickly become outdated.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Keep the asset as simple and easy to understand as possible. Avoid including unnecesary box
        art or key art. Keep in mind that due to the image size small text may be difficult to
        read.<br />
    </li>
    <li>Avoid including developer logos or unnecessary art<br /></li>
    <li>
        Remove unnecessary legal text. Sometimes this text is difficult to read due to the asset
        size. Legal text should be moved to the section in Steamworks dedicated to this.
    </li>
</ul>
