<h1>Promo Spot: Midweek Deal</h1>
Midweek Deals are a curated promotion on Steam. Games selected as Midweek Deals are featured on the
Steam homepage, in a Steam pop-up marketing banner, and may also be featured on Steam social media
channels.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Promotion Details</h2>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="2"></a>Duration</h2>
The Midweek Deals will be displayed on the front page of Steam and may also be featured on
appropriate tag pages (RPG, Simulation, VR, etc). Midweek Deals feature spots rotate between the
active Midweek Deals offers. As a result, your promo may be shown by default on the homepage to some
players while appearing in the second or third set of 'special offers' for other players. As with
all curated promotions on Steam, the discounts typically start and end at 10am Pacific time.<br />
<br />
Midweek Deals discounts are normally set for a week, starting Monday at 10am and running for a week.
If for some reason you need your discount to begin earlier or last longer than the usual time frame,
let us know.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="3"></a>Visibility</h2>
The Midweek Deals is featured on the homepage in the 'special offers' section and in the pop-up
marketing message window for 72 hours.

Once Valve has agreed to run your game as a Midweek Deals , here are next steps for getting set up:
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="5"></a>Assets used</h2>
The Midweek Deals promos use two unique banner images:<br />
<ul>
    <li>A Pop-up Marketing Message image<br /></li>
    <li>A Spotlight image</li>
</ul>
<br />
Please see <a href="/doc/store/assets/promos">Store Promo Graphical Assets</a> for details and
templates for these two required assets.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="6"></a>Delivering assets to Valve</h2>
Please send a link to your layered Adobe Photoshop files (.psd) for the above banners to Valve at
least one week ahead of your promotion. Please also include the font files for any non-standard
fonts that are used in your banners.<br />
<br />
Valve will take your layered files and translate your marketing banners into 20+ languages that we
use for our curated promotions.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="7"></a>Entering the discount</h2>
A discount event will be set up for you to enter your discounts. If you do not see a discount event,

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="8"></a>FAQ / Best Practices</h2>
<h4>Can bundles participate?</h4>
A bundle of games can be featured as a Midweek Deals. Typically, the contents of the bundle would
each have a discount applied to them for the duration of the Midweek Deals.<br />
<br />
The bundle must have all graphical assets and be set up ahead of time.
<h4>What discount should I run for my Midweek Madness?</h4>
The Midweek Madness is meant to be special and for a short window. Since it's a short promotional
window, we recommend going with the largest discount you'd like to offer, or at a minimum, matching
your best discount to-date. You also shouldn't feel obligated to continue raising your discount
after this special promotion. It's fine to step back down to a lower discount percentage during your
next sale.
<h4>This will be the first discount/promotion for my game. What discount should I run?</h4>
If this is your first discount, it's totally fine to go within the range of 15 to 25% for this deal.
Keep in mind that a discount of 20%+ will also trigger Steam wishlist notification, which can help
boost additional visibility.
<h4>How can I maximize the success of my Midweek Madness?</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Time with an update.</strong> Pairing a curated promotion feature with a content
        update or a special event can be very effective. The Midweek Madness feature uses custom
        authored banner images, so you can use some new artwork for your game, or include a brief
        message about your update in the banner to shine some additional light on your new update or
        event. Also, don't forget to activate an update visibility round to support the content
        update of the game, if applicable.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Stream to your store page. </strong> Livestreaming is a good way to drive engagement
        and showcase your game. Take advantage of the increased traffic by showcasing your game with
        a live broadcast. You can read instructions here:
        <a href="/doc/store/broadcast">Livestreaming</a><br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Make an announcement.</strong> This can be about the event or the new game content
        update. Not really related to the Midweek Madness, but definitely something you can do to
        further elevate the deal. Read more about
        <a href="/doc/marketing/event_tools">Steam event tools here</a>.
