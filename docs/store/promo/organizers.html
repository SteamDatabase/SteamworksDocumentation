<h1>Hosting Third-Party Sales Events</h1>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Overview</h2>
Are you interested in hosting a Sales Event on Steam, or expanding your off-Steam gaming event with
an on-Steam presence? <br />
<br />
If so, Steam can equip you with tools to create your own
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/promo/thirdpartyevents" class="bb_doclink"
    >Third-Party Sales Event</a
>. These allow you to build and manage your own custom event landing pages on Steam. In exceptional
cases, these third-party events may even qualify for featuring on the homepage of the Store as
described below. <br />
<br />
Here's a small sample of some the creative event ideas we've seen third-parties bring to Steam:
<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        <strong>Publisher Sales Events</strong> - like the

</ul>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="2"></a>How It Works</h2>
Follow the steps below to bring your events to Steam. This process can be quick and easy if you only
plan to include your own games and you're already familiar with the event tools, or it can be long
and involved if you plan to include many games across multiple publishers. In short, the scope of
your production will scale with the scope of your event idea. <br />
<br />
If this is your first time organizing a Sales Event on Steam, please plan for a
<strong>minimum of three months</strong> to complete the following steps. If you are seeking curated
featuring, Steam's promotional calendar fills up quickly, so you'll likely want even more lead time.
<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <h2 class="bb_subsection">
        <a name="3"></a>1. Submit your Event Idea to the Steam Events Team
    </h2>
    Outline your event idea and submit it via this
    <a
        href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/wizard/HelpWithPublishing?issueid=938"
        target="_blank"
        rel="noreferrer"
        >Submission Form</a
    >. This will automatically open a ticket with the Steam Events Team to discuss your event
    proposal further. As part of this process, the team will ask you to confirm and agree to the
    <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc//store/promo/organizers#10" class="bb_doclink"
        >Event Rules</a
    >
    outlined below.
    <h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="4"></a>2. Design &amp; Build your Custom Sales Event</h2>
    If your event proposal is approved, the team will enable the event tools so you can start
    designing and building your own Sales Event and adding confirmed participants. When inviting
    potential participants to your event, be sure to share the information in
    <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/promo/thirdpartyevents" class="bb_doclink"
        >Participating in Third-Party Sales Events</a
    >
    with them. During the design process, please reference the
    <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc//resources/Sales_Feature_Beta" class="bb_doclink"
        >Sales Page Editor documentation</a
    >
    and, if your event includes a pre-recorded or live stream, you'll also want to review the
    <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/broadcast" class="bb_doclink"
        >Livestreaming documentation</a
    >. Be sure to reply to your open ticket with any questions.
    <h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="5"></a>3. Finalize Your Event Participants</h2>
    Once you've finalized the list of games that have agreed to join your event, please send their
    AppIDs to the Steam Events Team. This allows the team to create a custom discount for your
    participants (if relevant). This custom discount is not exempt from the usual
    <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/marketing/discounts#21" class="bb_doclink"
        >30-day discount cooldown</a
    >, so please let your participants know to plan accordingly. Note: a discount is not required
    for a game to appear on your Sale Page; it can be included at regular (full) price, but may
    impact featuring decisions. See Event Visibility below for details.
    <h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="6"></a>4. Ask About Potential Featuring Opportunities</h2>
    All events receive a certain amount of automatic visibility, but once Step 3 is complete, the
    Steam Events Team can make an informed decision and let you know if your event qualifies for
    additional curated Store featuring. See
    <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc//store/promo/organizers#16" class="bb_doclink"
        >Event Visibility</a
    >
    below for details.
    <h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="7"></a>5. Submit your Sale Page for Review</h2>
    When you've finalized your Sale Page, submit it to the Steam Events Team for review by pressing
    the 'Request Review' button at the top of the 'Sale' tab in the Sale Event Editor. The review
    process usually takes 2-3 business days, during which time the team will confirm that your event
    follows the
    <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc//store/promo/organizers#10" class="bb_doclink"
        >Event Rules</a
    >
    outlined below.
    <h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="8"></a>6. Publish Your Event Page</h2>
    Once your Event Page has been approved, you may publish your Sales Event when you're ready.
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="9"></a>Operational Tips</h2>
<div class="bb_callout">
    <div>
        <strong>Keep a Spreadsheet</strong> - If your event includes multiple games across multiple
        publishers, please keep a spreadsheet with the AppIDs of each participating game in a
        column. The Steam Events Team will ask for these AppIDs.
    </div>
</div>
<div class="bb_callout">
    <div>
        <strong>Beta Test Your Sale Page</strong> - Before submitting your Sale Page for review,
        it's a good idea have someone who is unfamiliar with the project take a look at your event
        assets. Show them only your header banner and ask them to describe what your event is about
        and what kinds of games they would expect to find on the page. If they can do so without
        hesitation, you're likely on the right track.
    </div>
</div>
<div class="bb_callout">
    <div>
        <strong>Remember Your Ticket Number</strong> - If your ticket with the Steam Team ever
        auto-closes due to inactivity, please open a new ticket and reference the old ticket number
        so a member of the Steam Team can reopen the original for you.
    </div>
</div>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="10"></a>Event Hosting Rules</h2>
When you host a Third-Party Sales Event on Steam, these are the main rules for you to know and agree
to:
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="11"></a>Stay on Topic</h2>
Think of your Sales Event as an essay. It needs a clear topic (thesis) and everything included must
be organized and relevant to that topic. This means:
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        1) Your assets must clearly identify what your event is about and the group that's
        organizing it.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        2) Your assets and all games included in your event must fit the theme or topic. No "friends
        of the host" sections, no "more from this publisher" footers, no "additional bundles" that
        include off-topic games, etc. <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        3) Similarly, the games on your sale page must be organized per your theme or topic. For
        example if your event is being featured as a discount event, then the top of your sale page
        must only feature games that are on discount (while non-discount elements like full-priced
        games, Demos, Coming Soon pages or 'Follow' widgets are moved to the bottom). <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        4) Don't position your third-party event to make it look like it's coming from Steam. For
        example, please avoid naming your event a "Fest" unless your event has been called this
        prior to promotion on Steam. This naming convention is reserved for official Steam-hosted
        Sales Events.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="12"></a>No Advertising or Special Treatment on Steam</h2>
Steam does not sell special placement on the Store or allow advertising, and neither can your Steam
Event. This means:
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        5) Your Sale Page can (and should!) share information on the organization hosting the event
        and what the event is about, but please don't promote or link to off-Steam content from your
        Sale Page (for example, third-party websites, stores, newsletters, services, etc). For
        Showcase, Regional or Themed events only, you may optionally include a few logos in a
        "thanks to our sponsors" or "thanks to our supporters" section, but this section must be
        placed near the bottom of the page after all game content or in a separate tab.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        6) If you're hosting a Showcase, Regional or Themed event, your Sale Page cannot give
        special placement to specific games based on your pre-existing business relationships,
        including your own games. You should always organize participating games in a way that's
        intuitive for customers, and enable the "Smart Section" functionality whenever feasible
        (which will organize the games included in a section automatically using an algorithm).<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        7) You cannot charge participants to be featured on your Sale Page. You may optionally
        charge a participation fee for your event's off-Steam features (for example booth space at a
        convention center or a segment in a produced livestream), but placement on your Steam Sale
        Page cannot be marketed as an upsell, nor can it be the only benefit offered by your
        participation fee.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_subsection">
    <a name="13"></a>Get Permission &amp; Set Expectations with your Participants
</h2>
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        8) The hosting of your event, use of the sale page editor tools, and any promotion on Steam
        are at the discretion of the Steam Events Team. <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        9) Please keep your participants up to date on any decision making. Don't promise a specific
        level of visibility for your event until its confirmed by the Steam Events Team. If your
        event is seeking curated featuring on the Store, please read
        <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc//store/promo/organizers#16" class="bb_doclink"
            >Event Visibility</a
        >
        below for additional tips, rules and requirements.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        10) Before adding a game to your Events Page, please get permission from the game or IP
        owner. Once a participating game has been included in your Sale Page, the owner of that game
        will see your event name and contact info in their Steamworks dashboard, even if your event
        is hidden or unpublished.
    </li>
</ul>
<div class="bb_callout bb_red">
    <div>
        <strong>11) AS ALWAYS</strong> - Valve respects the intellectual property rights of others,
        and we require that everyone using our internet sites and services do the same. You must
        secure proper permissions and usage rights for anything featured in your Sales Event,
        including participating games and IP.
    </div>
</div>
<h2 class="bb_subsection">
    <a name="14"></a>Special Rules for Publisher, Developer and Franchise Sales that Receive Curated
    Featuring
</h2>
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        12) Each game can only be included in at most <strong>one</strong> homepage-featured
        Publisher or Developer Sale per calendar year, regardless of the number of co-Publishers or
        co-Developers listed on its Store Page. If multiple options are available, pick the one that
        fits best. <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        13) A similar rule applies for homepage-featured Franchise Sales. If a game could join
        multiple homepage-featured Franchise Sales in a calendar year (for example a Lego Star Wars
        game), pick only the one that's the best fit.
        <ul class="bb_ul">
            <li>
                Note: These "calendar year rules" only apply to Publisher/Developer or Franchise
                Sales that receive curated homepage featuring. Otherwise, a game can join as many
                <i>non-curated</i> Publisher/Developer or Franchise Sales as it likes. See
                <a
                    href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc//store/promo/organizers#16"

                    >Event Visibility</a
                >
                below for details on curated featuring.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="15"></a>Event Visibility Off Steam</h2>
You and your event participants are encouraged to promote your Sales Event via your own marketing
efforts, social media channels or websites. Each participating game and developer can help amplify
the overall event through their own communication channels, so be sure to think about how they can
help get involved. It's also a good idea to provide your participants with pre-approved artwork and
messaging (also known as a comms kit or asset kit), which they can use when messaging their own
communities about your event, either ahead of time or once your event has gone live.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="16"></a>Event Visibility On Steam</h2>
Steam may also promote your event in a few places across the Store. This featuring falls into two
general categories, automatic and curated, which are described as follows:
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="17"></a><strong>Automatic Store Featuring</strong></h2>
Your Sales Event will automatically appear in the following placements throughout the Store: <br />
<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <img
        src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/SalesEventSpecialEvents.JPG"
        alt="SalesEventSpecialEvents.JPG"
        title="SalesEventSpecialEvents.JPG"
    />
    <h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="18"></a>Sale Event News Hub &amp; Special Events Page</h2>
    When your event begins, it will appear in the
    <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/collection/sales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
        >Sale Events News Hub</a
    >
    and
    <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/specials/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
        >Special Events Page</a
    >
    of the Store.
    <h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="19"></a>Store Page Banner</h2>
    Your Store Page banner will appear across the top of ALL games included in your Event Page. You
    can set these up in the 'Sale' tab of the Event Editor under 'Store Page Banner'. This banner
    helps build awareness for your event and can lead players to your sales homepage. The below
    example shows a Store Page Banner across the top the
    <strong>Rift of the NecroDancer</strong>
    Store Page, which promotes and links to the Save &amp; Sound Themed Sale.
</ul>
<div class="bb_callout bb_red">
    <div>
        <strong>NOTE:</strong> - Like all event assets, your Sale Page Banner MUST stay on topic
        (see Rules 1 &amp; 2 above). It cannot be used to cross-promote specific things other than
        the event itself. For example, a Store Page Banner for a Publisher Sale must be about that
        Publisher Sale and not about "Wishlist New Game X" or "Buy New Game Y."
    </div>
</div>
<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <strong>Example:</strong>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>This Store Page Banner:</th>
            <th>Links Customers to this Sales Event:</th>

            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="20"></a>Wishlist Notifications</h2>
    When a game participating in your Sales Event goes on a discount of at least 20%, players who
    have wishlisted that game will receive the usual
    <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc//marketing/wishlist" class="bb_doclink"
        >Steam Wishlist Notification</a
    >, which leads them to the game's Store Page, which in turn can lead them to your sale homepage
    via the Store Page Banner, as outlined above.
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="21"></a><strong>Curated Store Featuring</strong></h2>
A small subset of third-party events on Steam are chosen for curated featuring on the Store. This
featuring can include placements like the frontpage Takeunder, or Daily, Midweek and Weekend Deals.
<div class="bb_callout">
    <div>
        <strong>NOTE: </strong> - Very few events are chosen for curated promotion. If your event is
        not chosen, don't worry, it's not "game over." Your event may still publish its approved
        sale page on Steam, and it'll still be receive the Automatic Store Featuring described
        above. Indeed, many of today's most popular events on Steam ran for several years without
        curated featuring before they built up enough awareness and participants to reach the level
        of customer interest required curated featuring.
    </div>
</div>
<br />
The Steam Events Team will let you know if your event qualifies for curated featuring via your
ticket as outlined in Step 4 above. To maximize your event's chances of being selected for curated
featuring, you'll want to ensure you've done ALL of the following prior to reaching Step 4:

        <a name="22"></a>Stay on Topic &amp; Sufficiently Represent Your Chosen Topic
    </h2>
    All events should stay on topic (see Rules 1 - 4 above), but to be featured on the Store, an
    event must also extensively represent its chosen topic. For example, a Publisher Sale that
    didn't include the publisher's most popular games or editions likely wouldn't be selected for
    curated featuring. Similarly, a "Platformer Game Celebration" would need hundreds of
    participants to sufficiently represent the full breadth of the Platformer genre. In this regard,
    choosing a narrower theme can actually help. For example pivoting to a "Roguelike Platformer
    Celebration," would also reduce the number of participating games you'd need to sufficiently
    represent your new, narrower theme.
    <h2 class="bb_subsection">
        <a name="23"></a>Include Participating Games with Lots of Customer Interest
    </h2>
    Steam prefers to feature events which include games that generate lots of customer interest. The
    factors that determine customer interest are described in greater detail in
    <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc//marketing/visibility#7" class="bb_doclink"
        >Visibility on Steam: Key Visibility Elements</a
    >. In short, Steam assumes that the customer interest in an event is the sum total of the
    customer interest in all the individual games included in the event. This means your event is
    not penalized for including games with low customer interest, but you'll still want to include
    as many games with high customer interest as possible to maximize your events' chances of being
    chosen for curated promotion.
    <h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="24"></a>Minimize Overlap with Other Featured Events</h2>
    Steam is highly unlikely to feature multiple events with similar themes within the same calendar
    year, or even within a few months of each other in separate calendar years. For example, if two
    organizations separately pitched a "Games from Finland" regional sale event within the same
    year, we would likely encourage them to work together on a single Games from Finland sale the
    next year.
    <h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="25"></a>Build in Lots of Lead Time</h2>
    Steam's promotional calendar tends to fill up about 6 to 10 weeks out, so you should aim to
    finalize your list of participants at least a month or two ahead of your chosen start date. This
    is also important because a few additional operational steps will be required to ensure your
    event is ready for Steam's global audience. These include:
    <ul class="bb_ul">
        <li>
            Asset Intake - The Steam Team will request layered PSDs of your event assets to feature
            on the Store. Please design these to clearly present: the theme of your sale, the
            organizer of the sale (aka "presented by"), and the dates that your Sales Event will be
            active. These layered PSDs should be delivered no later than two weeks before the start
            of your event. <br />
        </li>
        <li>
            Discount Participation - If your Sale Page is being featured as a discounted sales event
            (e.g., a Daily Deal, Midweek Deal or Weekend Deal), then a large majority of the
            released games on your Sale Page must be on discount during your featuring dates. If
            they are not, or if a significant number of participants opt out of the discount event
            at the last minute, Steam may cancel your curated featuring. <br />
        </li>
        <li>
            Localization - The Steam Events team will localize your PSD assets for you, but you'll
            be responsible for localizing the Sale Page itself. This means you should use Steam’s
            pre-localized text strings when building out your Sale Page, or, if you choose to use
            your own custom text strings, you should plan to localize them into all of
            <a
                href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/localization/languages"
                class="bb_doclink"
                >Steam's supported languages</a
            >. NOTE - An exception is allowed for Regional Sales that are only being featured in one
            region. For example, a "Games from Japan" sale that's only being featured in Japan
            should only require two localizations: Japanese and English as a backup.
        </li>
    </ul>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="26"></a>Example Work-Back Schedule</h2>
When planning a sales event, there are many factors that take time to coordinate and organize. As
such, we recommend that you start planning at least three months ahead of the date you wish to run
your event.<br />
<br />
Your specific event may have more or fewer moving parts than this example, but this should help give
you a general idea of some of the required milestones and the production timelines involved. <br />

Here are some example assets we've received from past events. Of course, no two events are exactly
alike, but we wanted to highlight these few because they accomplish several important communication
goals:
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        The event's theme comes through clearly for customers, even after a quick glance. <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Customers get a quick sense of kinds of games the Sales Page will include, even before they
        click the banner. <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        The event's host is clearly presented, or, in the case of Franchise Sales and Publisher
        Sales, it's implicit.<br />
    </li>
    <li>If the event has a livestream component, the asset communicates when it begins.</li>

        <h4>
            Q: I was invited to join a Third-Party Sales Event by someone outside my organization.
            Should I participate?
        </h4>
        <strong>A:</strong> This is up to you. If the event's theme or topic fits your game's
        positioning and branding, and the dates line up with your own promotional plans, you are
        encouraged to join. See

        <h4>
            Q: Is there a limit to the number of Sales Events I can run, or the number of Sales
            Events my game can participate in?
        </h4>
        <strong>A:</strong> In general, you can run as many Sales Events as you'd like and a game
        can participate in as many Sales Events as it would like, but there are a few limitations:
        <ul class="bb_ul">
            <li>
                Don't forget the once-per-calendar-year rule for
                <strong>featured</strong> Publisher/Developer and Franchise sales (see Rules 12
                &amp; 13 mentioned above). <br />

                The Steam Events Team may reject similar event ideas that are run too frequently, or
                run back to back, even if they're not receiving curated featuring. Steam Events
                aren't meant to be "evergreen" or re-run in rapid succession.

        <h4>
            Q: Can I include Coming Soon games, Follow buttons, Early Access games, Playtests or
            Demos in my Sales Event?
        </h4>
        <strong>A:</strong> Yes, this is fine as long as these apps and widgets are on topic and
        otherwise follow the rules outlined above. If your event is a discount event (for example, a
        publisher sale), you'll want to design your sale page such that the elements that aren't on
        discount are positioned lower on the page than the elements that are on discount. In other
        words, non-discounted items should move to the bottom of the page.<br />

    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>
            Q: Some of my participants will be announcing new games during my event? Can I feature
            their Coming Soon pages on my Sale Page once they've been revealed?
        </h4>
        <strong>A:</strong> Yes, this is fine, but if you want to add a game to your sale page
        before its Coming Soon store page has been released, you'll need to use the 'Add by ID'
        button since the game's name wont appear in search yet. Even after the App ID has been
        added, the game still won't appear on your sale page until its Coming Soon page has also
        been released, and then it should appear automatically. If you need to add an entire section
        to your Sale Page during your event, for example a 'Just Announced' section that includes
        multiple reveals, this will need to be done as an edit to your live store page during the
        event, so please let the Steam Events Team know your plans in your ticket. Otherwise, they
        may lock your events page once its approved.<br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Q: Can my sales event feature a charity?</h4>
        <strong>A:</strong> Yes, charity events are allowed, but keep in mind they must still follow
        the rules outlined elsewhere in documentation. We sometimes receive charity event
        submissions featuring a charity and a collection of unrelated games with no clear theme or
        through line, which makes it difficult to offer curated featuring. If curated featuring is a
        goal of your charity event, it's a good idea to match the theme of your sales event to the
        theme of the charity itself. For example, a collection of forest-themed games would be a
        great fit for a 'Save the Rainforests' charity event.
