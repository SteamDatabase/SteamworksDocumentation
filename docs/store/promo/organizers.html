<h1>Hosting Third-Party Sales Events</h1>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Overview</h2>
Are you interested in hosting a Sales Event on Steam, or expanding your off-Steam gaming event with
an on-Steam presence? <br />
<br />
If so, Steam can equip you with tools to create your own
<a href="/doc/store/promo/thirdpartyevents">Third-Party Sales Event</a>. These allow you to build
and manage your own custom event landing pages on Steam. In exceptional cases, these third-party
events may even qualify for featuring on the homepage of the Store as described below. <br />
<br />
Here's a small sample of some the creative event ideas we've seen third-parties bring to Steam:
<br />
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Publisher Sales Events</strong> - like the

</ul>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="2"></a>How It Works</h2>
Bringing your event to Steam can be a straightforward process—or a more involved one—depending on
the scope of your plans. If this is your first time organizing a Sales Event on Steam, plan for at
least three months to complete the steps below. If you're hoping for curated Store featuring, note
that Steam’s promotional calendar fills up fast, so additional lead time is recommended.
<ul>
    <h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="3"></a>1. Submit Your Event Idea</h2>
    Start by outlining your event concept and submitting it via this
    <a
        href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/wizard/HelpWithPublishing?issueid=938"
        target="_blank"
        rel="noreferrer"
        >Submission Form</a
    >. This will automatically open a ticket with the Steam Events Team, who will review your
    proposal and confirm your agreement to the
    <a href="/doc//store/promo/organizers#10">Event Hosting Rules</a>
    outlined below.
    <h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="4"></a>2. Design &amp; Build Your Custom Event</h2>
    If your proposal is approved, the Events Team will enable the event tools so you can stage a
    Sale Page and start inviting participants. Be sure to share our guide on
    <a href="/doc/store/promo/thirdpartyevents">Participating in Third-Party Sales Events</a>
    with any partners you invite. Use the
    <a href="/doc//resources/Sales_Feature_Beta">Sales Page Editor documentation</a>
    to aid your sale page design, and consult the
    <a href="/doc/store/broadcast">Livestreaming documentation</a>
    if you plan to include video content. You can reply to your open ticket at any time with
    questions.
    <h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="5"></a>3. Confirm your Event's Participants</h2>
    Once you have a list of confirmed games that are participating in your event, please send their
    AppIDs to the Events Team via your ticket. If needed, the team can create an optional custom
    discount slot for your sale event that will appear in your participants' discount management
    tool. Note that these discounts are not exempt from the standard 30-day cooldown, so our
    participants should plan their discounts accordingly.
    <h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="6"></a>4. Ask About Additional Featuring</h2>
    By default, all events receive automatic Store featuring as described in
    <a href="/doc//store/promo/organizers#16">Event Visibility</a>
    below. However, once your event has submitted a confirmed list of participants, the Steam Events
    Team will review it to assess whether your event qualifies for additional curated Store
    featuring, such as a daily, midweek or weekend deal, or a homepage takeunder.
    <h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="7"></a>5. Submit Your Sale Page for Review</h2>
    When your Sale Page is complete, click 'Request Review' in the ‘Sale’ tab of the Sale Event
    Editor. Reviews typically take 2–3 business days, during which the team will ensure your event
    complies with the
    <a href="/doc//store/promo/organizers#10">Event Hosting Rules</a
    >.
    <h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="8"></a>6. Publish Your Event</h2>
    Once your sales event has been approved, you’re free to publish it whenever you’re ready. Keep
    in mind that, once published, this will immediately trigger your event's automatic visibility as
    outlined in
    <a href="/doc//store/promo/organizers#16">Event Visibility</a
    >. Otherwise, your sales page will otherwise remain visible until you choose to hide it.
</ul>
<div class="bb_callout bb_red">
    <div>
        <strong> Can I add more participants later? </strong> Yes, it's fine to add a few more
        participants to your event after Step 3 or 4 — a few stragglers and late confirmations are
        common. Keep in mind though that completing Step 5 will typically lock your sale page.
    </div>
</div>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="9"></a>Operational Tips</h2>
<div class="bb_callout">
    <div>
        <strong>Keep a Spreadsheet</strong> - If your event includes multiple games across multiple
        publishers, please keep a spreadsheet with the AppIDs of each participating game in a
        column. The Steam Events Team will ask for these AppIDs.
    </div>
</div>
<div class="bb_callout">
    <div>
        <strong>Beta Test Your Sale Page</strong> - Before submitting your Sale Page for review,
        it's a good idea have someone who is unfamiliar with the project take a look at your event
        assets. Show them only your header banner and ask them to describe what your event is about
        and what kinds of games they would expect to find on the page. If they can do so without
        hesitation, you're likely on the right track.
    </div>
</div>
<div class="bb_callout">
    <div>
        <strong>Remember Your Ticket Number</strong> - If your ticket with the Steam Team ever
        auto-closes due to inactivity, please open a new ticket and reference the old ticket number
        so a member of the Steam Team can reopen the original for you.
    </div>
</div>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="10"></a>Event Hosting Rules</h2>
When you host a Third-Party Sales Event on Steam, these are the main rules for you to know and agree
to:
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="11"></a><strong>Stay on Topic</strong></h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>1) Clear Presentation </strong> - Your sales page and event asset must clearly
        identify your event's topic and the organization hosting the event. Avoid naming your event
        a “Fest” unless that name predates its Steam promotion. This terminology is reserved for
        official Steam-hosted events. <br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>2) No Off-Topic Games </strong> - All games included in your sales event must be
        relevant to your chosen topic. Event submissions that include off-topic games will fail
        review, so please don't include off-topic sections or callouts for “other great games,”
        “friends of the host,” “more from this publisher,” etc.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_subsection">
    <a name="12"></a><strong>No Ads or Special Treatment on Steam</strong>
</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>3) No Promoting Off-Steam Content</strong> - Your Steam Sales event may not promote
        or link to off-Steam content, such as external stores, services, podcasts, newsletters, etc.
        You may optionally include sponsor logos in a special 'Thanks to our Supporters' section
        near the bottom of your sales event, or in a separate tab—but it cannot contain any outbound
        links.<br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>4) No Selling Placement</strong> - You may optionally charge a participation fee for
        your event's off-Steam features — such as physical booth space at a convention center or a
        segment in a produced livestream — but you may not charge for placement on your Steam Sale
        Page. <br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>5) No Preferential Treatment</strong> - Games should be organized and grouped in a
        way that’s intuitive for customers, without giving preferential treatment to your own games
        or the games of your business partners. Use Steam’s “Smart Section” sorting whenever
        possible to help with this.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="13"></a>Get Permission &amp; Set Expectations</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>6) Steam Approval is Required</strong> - Use of sale page tools and any on-Steam
        promotion are subject to approval by the Steam Events Team.<br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>7) Secure Third-Party Approval &amp; Manage Expectations </strong> - As always,
        Steam requires you respect the intellection property (IP) rights of others and secure
        appropriate permissions to include any games, assets, or IP in your event. Keep participants
        informed of the status of your event, and don’t promise a level of visibility unless it's
        confirmed. See <a href="/doc//store/promo/organizers#16">Event Visibility</a> section for
        more details.
    </li>
</ul>
<div class="bb_callout bb_red">
    <div>
        <strong>Note</strong> - Even if your Event's Sale Page is unpublished or hidden, adding
        games to it will automatically enable the developers of those games to see your contact
        info, event name, and event date in their Steamworks dashboards.
    </div>
</div>
<h2 class="bb_section">
    <a name="14"></a>Special Rules for Events that Receive Curated Homepage Featuring
</h2>
These last few rules only apply if your event is chosen for curated homepage featuring. See
<a href="/doc//store/promo/organizers#16">Event Visibility</a> for details on curated featuring.
<ul>
    <li>
        A) To be featured as a discount event (e.g. Daily, Midweek or Weekend Deal), most of the
        participating titles will need to be on discount during the featuring window, and the the
        discounted offers should be presented at the top of the sale page, above any non-discounted
        items, such as demos or coming soon games.<br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        B) Each game can only appear in one homepage-featured Publisher or Developer Sale per
        calendar year—regardless of how many publishers or developers worked on the game. If
        multiple options are available, choose the sales event that best fits.<br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>C) Games can only appear in one homepage-featured Franchise Sale per calendar year.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="15"></a>Event Visibility Off Steam</h2>
We encourage you and your participating developers to promote your Sales Event through any of your
own marketing, social media, and websites. Each game and developer can help amplify the event by
engaging their individual communities—so think about how they can contribute. To make promotion
easier, consider providing a communications or asset kit with pre-approved artwork and messaging
that participants can use both before and during the event.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="16"></a>Event Visibility On Steam</h2>
Steam may also promote your event in a few places across the Store. This featuring falls into two
general categories, automatic and curated, which are described as follows:
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="17"></a><strong>Automatic Store Featuring</strong></h2>
<div class="bb_callout bb_red">
    <div>
        Note: Though it’s rare, some events may be excluded from automatic featuring, for example if
        they only feature a single game, or if they are very similar to other events which have run
        this year. If your event doesn’t qualify for automatic featuring, the Steam Events team will
        let you know.
    </div>
</div>
In most cases, a Sales Event will automatically appear in the following placements throughout the
Store:<br />
<ul>
    <h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="18"></a>Sale Event News Hub &amp; Special Events Page</h2>
    When your event begins, it will appear in the
    <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/collection/sales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
        >Sale Events News Hub</a
    >
    and
    <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/specials/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
        >Special Events Page</a
    >
    of the Store.
    <table>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <th>Example:</th>
                <td>
                    <img

            </tr>
            <tr></tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
    <h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="19"></a>Store Page Banner</h2>
    Once your Sales Event is published, your Store Page banner will appear on the store page of ALL
    games included in your Event Page for up to 2 weeks. These require Valve approval. You can set
    these up in the 'Sale' tab of the Event Editor under 'Store Page Banner'. This banner helps
    build awareness for your event and can lead players to your sales homepage. The below example
    shows a Store Page Banner across the top the
    <strong>Rift of the NecroDancer</strong>
    Store Page, which promotes and links to the Save &amp; Sound Themed Sale.

                </th>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
    <h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="20"></a>Wishlist Notifications</h2>
    When a game participating in your Sales Event goes on a discount of at least 20%, players who
    have wishlisted that game will receive the usual
    <a href="/doc//marketing/wishlist">Steam Wishlist Notification</a
    >, which leads them to the game's Store Page, which in turn can lead them to your sale homepage
    via the Store Page Banner, as outlined above.
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="21"></a><strong>Curated Store Featuring</strong></h2>
The Steam Events Team will let you know if your event qualifies for curated featuring via your
ticket as outlined in Step 4 above. This featuring can include homepage placements like the
<a href="/doc//marketing/upcoming_events/themed_sales#event_visibility">Takeunder</a>, or discount
placements like <a href="/doc/marketing/discounts#14">Daily, Midweek and Weekend Deals</a>.<br />
<br />
We tend to approach each decision from the customer's perspective. Events that resonate with
customers tend to meaningfully organize games into an intuitive and thorough browsing experience,
where fans of a specific genre or topic can dive deep. The best sale pages offer customers a benefit
beyond just presenting a collection of games on discount. <br />
<br />
As such, events chosen for curated featuring tend to have a combination of the following
characteristics:
<ul>
    <h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="22"></a>1. Broad Representation of their Chosen Topic</h2>
    To be featured on the Steam homepage, an event must broadly represent its chosen topic. "Broad
    representation" means it includes a wide variety of games from the chosen topic and it includes
    a significant portion of the most popular games from the chosen topic. Note that some game
    genres — for example 'Action', 'Horror', 'Strategy,' etc — can include thousands of Steam games
    across a wide variety of subgenres, which makes them very hard to represent comprehensively.
    <h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="23"></a>2. Clear and Specific Topics</h2>
    Curated featuring is more likely for an event with a well-defined and focused topic. Vague or
    subjective topics—like 'Beautiful Games,' 'Indie Games,' 'Classic Games,' etc.—can be
    interpreted in different ways by different customers, which makes broad representation harder to
    achieve.
    <h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="24"></a>3. Games with High Customer Interest</h2>
    While there's no penalty for including smaller or up &amp; coming titles, featuring games with
    strong customer interest (as outlined in
    <a href="/doc//marketing/visibility#7">Visibility on Steam: Key Visibility Elements</a
    >) increases the likelihood of curated featuring. Try to include as many high-interest games as
    possible that still fit your event's chosen topic.
    <h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="25"></a>4. Strong Off-Steam Presence</h2>
    Events with a major off-Steam presence—such as gaming conventions, award shows, or esports
    tournaments—can feel more impactful, timely and relevant for customers.
    <h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="26"></a>5. Discount Participation (for Discount Events)</h2>
    To be featured as a discount event (e.g. Daily, Midweek or Weekend Deal), most of the
    participating titles will need to be on discount during the featuring window, and the the
    discounted offers should be presented at the top of the sale page, above any non-discounted
    items, such as demos or coming soon games.
    <h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="27"></a>6. Minimal Overlap with Other Featured Events</h2>
    We’re more likely to feature your event if it doesn’t overlap with another featured event. For
    example, if two groups propose separate “Games from Finland” events, we’d likely suggest they
    combine efforts for a single promotion.
    <h2 class="bb_subsection">
        <a name="28"></a>7. Alignment with Steam’s Promo Calendar &amp; Operational Needs
    </h2>
    Our promotional calendar fills up 6–10 weeks in advance, so if you're aiming for curated
    support, try to finalize your participants at least 4–8 weeks before your intended launch.
    Additional prep is required for featured events, including:
    <ul>
        <li>
            Asset Delivery: We’ll need layered PSDs for use on the Store. These should clearly show
            the event’s theme, organizer ("presented by"), and event dates. Assets must be submitted
            no later than two weeks before the event starts.<br />
        </li>
        <li>
            Localization: While Steam will localize your PSDs, you’re responsible for localizing the
            sale page itself. Use Steam’s pre-localized text strings when possible. If using custom
            text, plan to localize into all of
            <a href="/doc/store/localization/languages">Steam's supported languages</a>—unless your
            event is region-specific (e.g. a "Games from Japan" event only featured in Japan would
            only need Japanese and English as a backup).
        </li>
    </ul>

        <strong>Tradeoffs —</strong> Note that the first three characteristics mentioned above
        together create a fundamental tradeoff for you consider if curated featuring is one of your
        event's goals. The broader your event's theme — for example "Platformer Games" — the more
        games you can potentially include, making it easier to meet the customer interest threshold.
        However, you'll also need more participating games to adequately represent your broader
        theme, as the 'Platformer' genre includes thousands of games across many subgenres. On the
        other hand, a narrower theme — for example "Roguelike Platformer Games" — makes it easier to
        achieve broad representation, but you'll have fewer games to generate the level of customer
        interest needed for curated featuring.
    </div>

<div class="bb_callout">
    <div>
        <strong>Remember— </strong> Very few events are chosen for curated promotion. If your event
        is not chosen, don't worry, your event may still publish its approved sale page on Steam,
        and it'll still be receive the Automatic Store Featuring described above. Indeed, many of
        today's most popular events on Steam ran for several years without curated featuring before
        they built up enough awareness and participants to reach the level of customer interest
        required curated featuring.

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="29"></a>Example Work-Back Schedule</h2>
When planning a sales event, there are many factors that take time to coordinate and organize. As
such, we recommend that you start planning at least three months ahead of the date you wish to run
your event.<br />
<br />
Your specific event may have more or fewer moving parts than this example, but this should help give
you a general idea of some of the required milestones and the production timelines involved. <br />

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="30"></a>Example Assets</h2>
Here are some example assets we've received from past events. Of course, no two events are exactly
alike, but we wanted to highlight these few because they accomplish several important communication
goals:
<ul>
    <li>
        The event's theme comes through clearly for customers, even after a quick glance. <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Customers get a quick sense of kinds of games the Sales Page will include, even before they
        click the banner. <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        The event's host is clearly presented, or, in the case of Franchise Sales and Publisher
        Sales, it's implicit.<br />
    </li>
    <li>If the event has a livestream component, the asset communicates when it begins.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="31"></a>FAQ</h2>
<ul class="%1$s">
    <li>
        <h4>
            Q: I was invited to join a Third-Party Sales Event by someone outside my organization.
            Should I participate?
        </h4>
        <strong>A:</strong> This is up to you. If the event's theme or topic fits your game's
        positioning and branding, and the dates line up with your own promotional plans, you are
        encouraged to join. See
        <a href="/doc/store/promo/thirdpartyevents">Participating in Third-Party Sales Event</a> for
        more information.<br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>
            Q: Is there a limit to the number of Sales Events I can run, or the number of Sales
            Events my game can participate in?
        </h4>
        <strong>A:</strong> In general, you can run as many Sales Events as you'd like and a game
        can participate in as many Sales Events as it would like, but there are a few limitations:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Don't forget the once-per-calendar-year rule for
                <strong>featured</strong> Publisher/Developer and Franchise sales (see 'Special
                Rules for Events that Receive Curated Home Featuring' above for details). <br />
            </li>
            <li>
                Keep in mind Steam's
                <a href="/doc/marketing/discounts#21">30-day discount cooldown</a> for any games
                that will be participating on discount. <br />
            </li>
            <li>
                The Steam Events Team may reject similar event ideas that are run too frequently, or
                run back to back, even if they're not receiving curated featuring. Steam Events
                aren't meant to be re-run in rapid succession.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>
            Q: Can I include Coming Soon games, Follow buttons, Early Access games, Playtests or
            Demos in my Sales Event?
        </h4>
        <strong>A:</strong> Yes, this is fine as long as these apps and widgets are on topic and
        otherwise follow the rules outlined above. If your event is a discount event (for example, a
        publisher sale), you'll want to design your sale page such that the elements that the
        discounted offers should be presented at the top of the sale page, above any non-discounted
        items, such as demos, Follow buttons or Coming Soon games.<br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>
            Q: Some of my participants will be announcing new games <i>during</i> my event? Can I
            feature their Coming Soon pages on my Sale Page once they've been revealed?
        </h4>
        <strong>A:</strong> Yes, this is fine, but if you want to add a game to your sale page
        before its Coming Soon store page has been released, you'll need to use the 'Add by ID'
        button since the game's name wont appear in search yet. Even after the App ID has been
        added, the game still won't appear on your sale page until its Coming Soon page has also
        been released, and then it should appear automatically. If you need to add an entire section
        to your Sale Page during your event, for example a 'Just Announced' section that includes
        multiple reveals, this will need to be done as an edit to your live store page during the
        event, so please let the Steam Events Team know your plans in your ticket. Otherwise, they
        may lock your events page once its approved.<br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Q: Can my sales event feature a charity?</h4>
        <strong>A:</strong> Yes, charity events are allowed, but keep in mind they must still follow
        the rules outlined elsewhere in documentation. We sometimes receive charity event
        submissions featuring a charity and a collection of unrelated games with no clear theme or
        through line, which makes it difficult to offer curated featuring. If curated featuring is a
        goal of your charity event, it's a good idea to match the theme of your sales event to the
        theme of the charity itself. For example, a collection of forest-themed games would be a
        good fit for a 'Save the Rainforests' charity event.
    </li>
</ul>
<br />
<ul class="%1$s">
    <li>
        <h4>
            Q: Can the topic of my sales event by a "launch party" for an upcoming game release?
        </h4>
        <strong>A:</strong> Aligning the launch of a new game with a Sale Event is allowed, but
        you'll want to make sure your event stays on topic (see Event Hosting Rules 1 &amp; 2
        above). Your two main options are: <br />
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Publisher Sale</strong>: If your event's topic is a publisher sale, you may
                include games from your entire publishing catalogue, but your sale page assets
                (including the Sale Page Header and Banner) must be about your larger publishing
                catalogue and brand; they can't specifically cross-promote the new release. In this
                case, you may still feature the new game on your sale page, for instance in a
                prominent section called "Just Released" <br />
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Franchise Sale</strong>: Alternatively, your event's topic may be a
                franchise sale, in which case your sale page assets may cross promote your new game
                as the newest installment for the franchise. If you choose this option, your sale
                page cannot include games from outside the franchise. <br />
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Note:</strong> Don't mix and match these options. For instance, don't set up
                your publisher sale with a Sale Page Banner that cross promotes your newest game. In
                either case, if your event is being featured as a discount event (e.g., a daily,
                midweek or weekend deal), please remember that the discounted offers should be
                presented at the top of the sale page, above any non-discounted items, such as demos
                or Coming Soon games.
