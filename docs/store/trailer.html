<h1>Trailers</h1>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Overview</h2>
As part of the release process on Steam, you will be required to upload a trailer for your product.
Trailers are displayed at the top of your product's store page and are often one of the first things
your potential customers will be seeing.<br />

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="2"></a>Best Practices</h2>
Trailers are important in marketing your product on Steam. You want to think about the context of
where your trailer will appear. For example, the customer may be going through their Discovery Queue
and looking at games that are recommended to them, and you may have less than 10 seconds to make an
impression. Or the customer may be watching your trailer without any audio. You will want to think
about how long it takes for the customer to learn about your product, and if they can learn about it
without audio.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="3"></a>Gameplay Trailers First</h2>
We have found that most Steam users are looking for <u>gameplay</u> of your game. We highly
recommend that the first trailer you list on your store page is primarily gameplay, showing the
player what they will be doing in the game and from the perspective that they will be interacting
with your game. It is also often beneficial to have the in-game HUD elements visible during gameplay
videos. Gameplay videos are a great way for players to quickly identify if they are interested in
looking for more information about your game.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="4"></a>Categorize Your Trailers</h2>
You can select a category for each trailer, specifying whether it is primarily gameplay, cinematics,
teaser, or a combination of those. This category will be displayed, along with the name you entered
for your trailer, in the video player on your game's store page to help players identify the videos
they are most interested in watching.<br />
<ul>
    <li>
        General / Cinematic - Most trailers fall into this category; these typically show a mix of
        pre-rendered video, logos, title screens, accolades, and maybe some limited amount of
        gameplay.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Teaser - A short video, often posted when a game is first announced, often doesn't show much
        of the game but instead teases the title, IP, or franchise.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Gameplay - When a trailer is mostly comprised of gameplay, showing the user what it's like
        to play the game and from the perspective that the player will be playing.<br />
    </li>
    <li>Interview / Dev Diary - Non-fiction interview or documentary video.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="5"></a>Manage The Order Of Your Trailers</h2>
Within the trailer management UI, you can drag and drop to reorder the list of videos to appear on
your game's store page. The first two valid trailers will be shown to players before any
screenshots, with any remaining trailers appearing after the list of screenshots.

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="7"></a>Uploading a Trailer</h2>
To upload your trailers, go to the Store Page Admin &gt; Trailers tab. The trailer should be the
highest resolution that you have, up to 1920 x 1080 resolution, 30/29.97 or 60/59.94 fps, high bit
rate (5,000+ Kbps) and in .mov, .wmv, or .mp4 container files. H.264 video and AAC audio is
preferred, but we can transcode from many formats. 16:9 aspect ratio is preferred since the Steam
client is optimized for widescreen, but 4:3 aspect ratio is accepted. Please note that audio will be
filtered down to regular stereo when we transcode the videos.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="8"></a>Advanced Settings</h2>
The Advanced Settings can be used if you have trailers in multiple languages or need to restrict
them to certain countries. You will not need to use the Advanced Settings if your trailer is visible
to all countries and languages.<br />
<br />
You can set the language that specific trailers will show to customers that have their settings set
to that language. The Base video should be set to the English trailer if you have trailers in
multiple languages. See <a href="/doc/store/localization">Localization and Languages</a> for more
information.<br />
<br />
If you have PEGI and ESRB rated videos that should only appear in certain countries, you can
restrict the visibility of your trailer to certain countries by using the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
    >ISO 3166-1 alpha-2</a
>
language codes. (Example: DE,FR,US,CA,MX)
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="9"></a>Trailer Thumbnail / Poster Images</h2>
As Steam processes the trailer you upload, it will automatically generate two images needed by the
store:<br />
<ul>
    <li>
        A poster image of 600px x 380px that displays in the video player until the video has loaded
        enough to start playing<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        A thumbnail image of 232px x 130px that is used to represent the trailer on your store page
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="10"></a>Custom thumbnail/poster image</h2>
If you are unhappy with the image automatically generated by Steam, you may upload your own image to
represent your trailer. It must be a frame from the video itself, and must be 1920x1080 .jpg or
.png<br />
<br />
<strong>Best practices:</strong> Try to get a frame that is representative of unique content in your
trailer, and avoid text.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="11"></a>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<h4>Q. Can I release my game while a trailer is encoding?</h4>
A. No, you cannot release your game while a trailer is in the process of converting. Please give
yourself enough time to upload and convert a trailer before you attempt to release your game. If you
already started converting a trailer and need to release your game, please cancel the trailer
request and start it again once your game has released.
<h4>Q. What do I do if my trailer appears to be stuck converting?</h4>
A. The trailer processing system works in a FIFO queue. If there is a long queue of trailers ahead
of yours, then it may take a few hours to complete the conversion. The position in the queue is
reported for each trailer in the Trailers tab. Note: Deletion / re-submission will move the trailer
to the back of the queue.
<h4>Q. What do I do if my trailer processing ended with an error?</h4>
A. The most common reason for a trailer to fail is the resolution of the video. Please ensure you
use a common resolution such as 1920x1080 or 1280x720 to avoid any downstream processing issues.
Another common issue is an unsupported audio sample rate (please use 44Khz or 48Khz).
<h4>Q. What is a microtrailer and how is it created?</h4>
A. Microtrailers are 6-second looping videos that summarize a game's trailer for use in quick-view
locations throughout the Steam Store, as in the various category hubs, special sale pages, and on
the homepage during seasonal sales events. Steam generates a game's micro trailer based on the first
video visible in its Store Page. It does this by taking six 1-second clips from various points in
the video, and stitching them together.
