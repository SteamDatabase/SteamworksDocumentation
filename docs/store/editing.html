<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="5"></a>Store Beta Mode</h2>
When you are initially creating your store page, or when editing an existing store page, you can see
most of your changes in beta mode before making those changes public. To view your page in beta mode
while editing your store page, simply click "Preview changes in store" link in the upper-right
corner of your page.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="6"></a>Where is my purchase button?</h2>
If your product is not yet released on Steam, then purchase buttons and packages will not be visible
when viewing your store page in beta mode. To make sure a purchase option is correctly configured,
please check under "Store packages, pricing, &amp; release dates" on your application landing page
to ensure that pricing has been entered, and that the name of the package is what you intend to
appear to the public. You can edit the package name by clicking on the package and selecting "Edit
Package Name" from the right-hand column on the package landing page.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="7"></a>Why do I see all my upcoming DLC listed?</h2>
By default, any DLC that has been created for your application will be in beta mode and appear
listed on your store page you while viewing your page in beta mode. Unless those DLC have been
released, they will not appear to the public.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="8"></a>Editing Store Page After Release</h2>
Once you have released your store page, you will have the option to update and make changes to your
store page yourself by going to the “Publish” tab. The changes made on the store page will show up
on the store page immediately after publishing them.<br /><br />If you would like to make edits to
the store page but do not wish to set it public yet, you can do so by clicking "Save" at the bottom
of the page and not publishing those changes. There will be a red bar at the top of the page if
there are unpublished changes for the app's store page.
