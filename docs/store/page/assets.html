<h1>Store Page Extra Asset Management</h1>
When you are crafting your written description on your game's store page, you are likely inserting
images or short animations to illustrate the key features that make your game unique. Our tools make
this easier to manage localized versions of these images and add helpful accessibility text for
each.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Localized image management</h2>
<br />
If you are uploading images that contain text, you can now easily manage localized version of those
images all together in an image group.<br />

/><br />
<br />
This gives you one single entry in your list of images and a quick menu option to edit the group.<br />
<br />
Editing the group gives you a pop-up to add, delete, or reassign images to specific languages.<br />

The biggest benefit to managing localized assets as a group is that you don't need separate entries
for each language in your written text. Instead, you'll simply insert the same localized image group
into every language that you've translated your post into, and Steam will show the correct image to
the viewer depending on their language settings.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="2"></a>Accessibility Text</h2>
<br />
For every image that you place in your written description of your store page, you can add alt text,
which will be surfaced to players using screen readers. To add alt text, navigate to your store page
editor, select the 'Description' tab and click the blue button right above the 'Upload Custom Image'
section. Alt text will also export/import along with your other store page text on the
'Localization' tab.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="error"></a>Asset Error</h2>
<br />
We currently only support the following file types for extra assets: .png, .jpg, and .gif. All
uploaded assets are automatically transcoded by Steamâ€™s systems. If you encounter an error when
uploading an asset, it could be due to a server issue or a transcoding error.<br />
<br />
First, please verify that your asset is valid and viewable in a browser. If it displays correctly in
your browser but still fails to upload or convert after multiple attempts, please

and include a link to the original failing asset file stored on a platform like Dropbox. the ticket
system converts all assets provided to jpg and may loose the specific problem we want to address.
This will help our team investigate the issue and also improve our transcoding pipeline.<br />
