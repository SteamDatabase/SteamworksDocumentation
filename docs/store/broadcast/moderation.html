There are several ways that you can moderate the chat on your broadcast on Steam using the built-in
moderation tools, and we'll cover the various ways to do that on this documentation page.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="2"></a>Before You Start</h2>
<br />
Make sure you are signed into the account that will be broadcasting on Steam or an account that has
been promoted to moderator status.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="3"></a>Defining Moderators for Broadcast Chat</h2>
There are a couple ways you can add or update moderators that are allowed to help in your broadcast
chat room.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="4"></a>In Chat</h2>
From within the broadcast chat itself, you can right click on an account and select the option to
make them a moderator. Note: users who have been promoted to moderator status cannot promote other
users to moderator.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="5"></a>Friends List</h2>
You can select from your list of friends to elevate someone to be a moderator whenever your account
is broadcasting. Note that this will follow you around, allowing the account to moderate any
broadcast of yours.<br />

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="6"></a>Moderating Chat</h2>
There are several places you can moderate the chat on your Steam broadcast: on your store page, on
your steam broadcast page, and in the chatonly view. Once you see the chat, you can click on any
line of chat to bring up the moderation tools:<br />
<br />
<ul>
    <li>Remove this user's messages<br /></li>
    <li>Mute user for 12 hours<br /></li>
    <li>Mute user for a week<br /></li>
    <li>Mute user permanently<br /></li>
    <li>Unmute<br /></li>
    <li>Make this user a Moderator<br /></li>
    <li>Remove Moderator status for user</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="7"></a>Store page</h2>
From your Steam store page, click on Show Chat underneath your broadcast to view the chat.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="8"></a>Broadcast page</h2>
From your Steam broadcast page--which you can access from your store page broadcast by clicking on
"View broadcast page".
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="9"></a>Chat only view</h2>
To help with dedicated moderation tasks, you can open any broadcast chat in it's own window. There
are two ways to get to this view:<br />
<ul>
    <li>
        By using this URL format:<br />
        <div class="bb_code">
            https://steamcommunity.com/broadcast/chatonly/&lt;steamID of the broadcaster&gt;
        </div>
        <br />
        The SteamID used here is the 64-bit Steam ID. A quick way to view your 64-bit Steam ID is to
        visit this URL:
        <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/broadcast/moderators" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
            >https://steamcommunity.com/broadcast/moderators</a
        >
        (Your Steam ID will be appended to the end of this URL when you visit this site.)<br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Or, navigate to
        <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/broadcast/upload" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
            >http://steamcommunity.com/broadcast/upload</a
        >
        and then click on Broadcast Chat to open a new window to display all of the chat on your
        broadcast.
    </li>
</ul>
<br />
To open moderation menu on the chat only page, click the arrow on the right-hand side of any line of
chat.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="10"></a>Viewing Moderators and Moderation History</h2>
<br />

as view the moderation history.<br />
<br />
