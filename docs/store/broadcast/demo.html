<h1>Broadcasting a Game Demo to the Steam Store</h1>
Broadcasting gameplay from a Demo App to the Steam Store can be beneficial. For instance, it can be
a great way to show future fans content in the game prior to its launch and may encourage Steam
customers to try out the demo for themselves. <br /><br />This document will outline the steps to
successfully stream a demo to your Steam store page. Streaming a demo to the Steam store is
different in a few area than streaming the base game. This document will outline those differences.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="background"></a>Background</h2>
Demos on Steam have separate appID from their base games. They do not have their own Steam store
page and instead are discovered by users by search, by download demo appearing on the base game
store page or the
<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/demos/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
    >Demo Content Hub</a
>
or being part of Steam Next Fest type events.<br /><br />Learn more about setting up a Demo

>.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="consideration"></a>Demo Streaming Consideration</h2>
Since Demos do not have their own store page, you cannot use the Demo appID for setting up your
stream. The Demo appID will not automatically appear on the base game store page. Even though you
are streaming demo content, you must indicate that you are streaming the base game to Steam
Broadcast. The other important consideration is using a Steam account which is allowed to play the
base game. The Steam account can acquire the base game a few ways:<br /><br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>It is a member of the Steamworks Partner Group with access to the game.<br /></li>
    <li>
        Has a license for the game either via purchase or a product key, if the game is released.<br />
    </li>
    <li>Has a release override license for the game if the game is unreleased.</li>
</ul>
<br />The Steam Broadcast servers will prevent streaming of content which the Steam user account is
not permitted to play. This is a general safeguard to prevent unintentionally leaking game content
via Steam broadcast.
<div class="bb_callout">
    <div>
        You cannot use the Steam Client built-in broadcasting feature to Stream demo gameplay to the
        Steam Store, because the client will use the Demo appID. Since the Demo appID does not match
        the base game appID, it will not appear on the base game Steam store page. If you intend to
        stream Demo gameplay to the Steam store, you will need to use 3rd-party streaming software.

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="setup"></a>Streaming Setup</h2>
The following actions are required:<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        Setup the prerequisite for your streaming account as outlined by the
        <a
            href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/broadcast/setting_up#2"

            rel="noreferrer"
            >requirements section</a
        >. <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Allow the streaming Steam account permissions to broadcast onto the Base Game store page as
        <a
            href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/broadcast/setting_up#steamevent"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noreferrer"
            >outlined here</a
        >. This permission is granted either using a Steam Event or until it's removed from the
        Special Settings of the Store Page Edit and the store page is then re-published.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        You need to use external software to stream a demo to Steam, thus you need to prepare your
        streaming Steam account's RTMP Server and Token as
        <a
            href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/broadcast/setting_up#3"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noreferrer"
            >defined here</a
        >. Remember to setup the Broadcast appID to your base game's appID, not your demo appID.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Do not play the Demo app using the same Steam Account you plan to use for broadcasting. Why?
        Playing a game in the Steam library will inform the Broadcast system of the AppID the
        account is playing. The broadcast system will prefer the game being played by the library
        over the AppID value configured on the
        <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/broadcast/upload" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
            >Broadcast configuration page</a
        >. If you want to play the demo app then use a different Steam account than the one used for
        broadcasting.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="1"></a>Streaming Software</h2>
There are many existing software packages that let you stream your game to a platform like Steam. We
are going to give a quick example of using an open-source option called OBS (Open Broadcaster
Software).
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="obs"></a>OBS Quickstart</h2>
Steps for using OBS to setup a stream to Steam. Your OBS version may have a slightly different user
interface, however, the overall steps should be the same.<br />
<ol class="bb_ol">
    <li>Start running the Demo app, so it is ready for OBS to capture content.<br /></li>
    <li>
        Define a scene. You can name it anything.<br /><br /><img

        /><br /><br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Setup a source for OBS to capture video and audio content. OBS has a default source called
        'Game Capture'. Create a new one with any name you want. <br /><br /><img
