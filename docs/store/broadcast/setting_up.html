<h1>Setting Up A Stream</h1>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Overview</h2>
In this tutorial, we will walk you through the steps required to broadcast your game on the Steam
storefront.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="2"></a>Before You Begin</h2>

<ul>
    <li>
        You will need a non-limited Steam account. “Non-limited” means that the Steam account you
        plan to stream from must have spent at least $5 USD on the Steam store. “Limited” accounts
        (accounts that have not spent at least $5 USD on Steam) will not be able to create an RTMP
        token and will not be able to stream to a store page on Steam.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        The account you plan to stream from must own the game it will be streaming from. You can
        check this by logging into the Steam client with this account and confirming you see the
        game in your Steam Library.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        The account must either have the "Broadcast Live" permission in the Steamworks partner
        account, or be a member of the

</ul>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="3"></a>Setting up your Stream using RTMP</h2>
<br />
The steps below will help you gather the information required to stream your game from third-party
broadcasting software. Streaming on Steam uses the RTMP protocol. You won’t need to know exactly how
this protocol works to stream on Steam, but some familiarity with the below concepts will be
helpful.<br />
<ol>
    <li>
        Go to
        <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/broadcast/upload/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
            >http://steamcommunity.com/broadcast/upload/</a
        >
        <br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Click on "Create RTMP Token" to find an upload server. Steam will automatically select an
        upload server that’s close to your current location based on your IP address. The computer
        that is streaming your game will send video to that upload server.<br />
        <br />
        <img
            src="https://cdn.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/stream1.png"
            alt="stream1.png"
            title="stream1.png"
        /><br />
        <br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Locate your RTMP token. You will need to enter this token into your streaming software.<br />
        <br />
        <strong>What is an RTMP token?</strong><br />
        <br />
        An RTMP token is a unique identifier to allow you to stream on Steam. You will generate this
        token at
        <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/broadcast/upload" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
            >https://steamcommunity.com/broadcast/upload</a
        >, and enter it into the software you plan to use to stream your game to Steam.
        <div class="bb_callout">
            <div>
                <u>Important</u>: Treat your token like a password, and Never share it, as anyone
                who has it can stream as you. If you believe your key is compromised, you can
                invalidate it and generate a new one on this page.

        /><br />
        <br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Enter Your Game's AppID<br />
        <br />
        You can see your game’s App ID by visiting your game’s App landing page in Steamworks or
        going to your game’s Steam store page--your appID is in the URL.<br />
        <br />
        Note that you should only use the appID for your “base” game--do not use the appID for DLC,
        Demos, Soundtracks, or other secondary application types.<br />
        <br />

        /><br />
        <br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Set Your Broadcast Permissions<br />
        <br />
        By default, your stream is set to “Friends Only”, which means it’s only visible by you and
        your friends on Steam. This is a good way to test your stream before it’s publicly visible
        on your store page. You can check your Stream by clicking the “Your broadcast URL” under
        Quick Links on this page. Once you are ready for your stream to appear publicly on your
        store page, you can change this permission to “Public”.<br />

</ol>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="4"></a>Setting up OBS <i>(Optional)</i></h2>
There are several software tools available for streaming your game to Steam. OBS is a popular free
and open-source option. Below are steps to get your stream set up in OBS. Steam supports any
broadcast software that supports the RTMP protocol.<br />
<br />

    alt="stream5.png"
    title="stream5.png"
/><br />
<ol>
    <li>
        Navigate to File--&gt;Settings--&gt;Stream<br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        In the dropdown menu, select “Custom...”<br />
        <br />
        <img
            src="https://cdn.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/stream6.png"
            alt="stream6.png"
            title="stream6.png"
        /><br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        In the “Server” field, use the RTMP URL generated under the “Upload Server” field at
        <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/broadcast/upload/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
            >http://steamcommunity.com/broadcast/upload/</a
        ><br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        In the “Stream Key” field, enter the token provided at
        <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/broadcast/upload/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
            >http://steamcommunity.com/broadcast/upload/</a
        ><br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        In OBS, navigate to File--&gt;Settings--&gt;Output<br />
        <br />
        <img
            src="https://cdn.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/stream7.png"
            alt="stream7.png"
            title="stream7.png"
        /><br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Under Output Mode, select “Advanced” in the drop-down menu.<br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        On the Streaming tab, enter Keyframe Interval to 2.
        <u>Note: This step is important. Without this setting your stream will fail to start.</u>
    </li>
</ol>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="5"></a>Testing Your Stream</h2>
Once you are ready, begin streaming your game using OBS. Next, go back to
<a href="http://steamcommunity.com/broadcast/upload/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
    >http://steamcommunity.com/broadcast/upload/</a
>
and look for a link to the right of the page called “Your Broadcast URL”.<br />
<br />
<img
    src="https://cdn.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/stream8.png"
    alt="stream8.png"
    title="stream8.png"
/><br />
<br />
You should see your gameplay being streamed on this page. At this point, if you set your broadcast
permission to “Friends only”, your stream is not public yet.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="steamevent"></a>Create a Steam Event For Your Game</h2>
It's a good idea to let your community know about your stream. You can do this using the Event tools
on Steamworks. Below is a brief guide to setting up a Live-Stream/Broadcast event. You can learn
more about Events on Steam here:
<a href="/doc/marketing/event_tools" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
    >https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/marketing/event_tools</a
>.<br />
<br />
Follow these steps:<br />
<ol>
    <li>
        From your game’s App Landing Page, under the section "Community &amp; Moderation", click on
        “Post/Manage Events &amp; Announcements”.<br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Click on the blue "Create new Event or Announcement" button.<br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Select “Live-Stream/Broadcast” <br />
        <br />
        <img
            src="https://cdn.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/stream10.png"
            alt="stream10.png"
            title="stream10.png"
        /><br />
        <br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Navigate to the “Broadcasting” tab<br />
        <br />
        <img
            src="https://cdn.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/stream11.png"
            alt="stream11.png"
            title="stream11.png"
        /><br />
        <br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Enable the broadcast feature on the event to reveal a few setup options for the
        broadcast.<br />
        <br />
        <img
            src="https://cdn.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/stream14.png"
            alt="stream14.png"
            title="stream14.png"
        /><br />
        <br />
        Here you can enter a title for your broadcast from the list, or enter your own. If you enter
        a custom name, don’t forget to add localized titles.<br />
        <br />
        <img
            src="https://cdn.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/stream12.png"
            alt="stream12.png"
            title="stream12.png"
        /><br />
        <br />
        This is where you will designate one or more Steam accounts as allowed to stream to your
        store page during the event. Add the account you intend to Stream with:<br />
        <br />
        <img
            src="https://cdn.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/stream13.png"
            alt="stream13.png"
            title="stream13.png"
        /><br />
        <br />
        <u>Important:</u> The Steam account setting up the stream and the account that is streaming
        must be friends in order for it to be visible on this page.<br />
        <br />
        <strong>Suggested but optional:</strong> upload artwork (which you can re-use in the future)
        for your livestream. This artwork will appear on both sides of your livestream. <br />
        <br />
        Click the “Save” button to save your event.<br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Go to the “Options” tab and confirm the start and stop times of the event are correct. You
        can continue your stream for up to 24 hours past the end time of your event.<br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Save and publish your event. When you start streaming during the event, your stream will
        appear on your store page. Note that There may be a delay up to 5 minutes before the stream
        is picked up on the store page once you start streaming, so you may want to begin the stream
        a few minutes early to account for this.
    </li>
</ol>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="6"></a>Troubleshooting:</h2>
<br />
Q: I don’t see my broadcast on my Steam store page!<br />
<br />
<ul>
    <li>
        A.You may need to refresh the product page after a few seconds. We only display the live
        broadcast once a connection is established. First viewers will take the longest to establish
        the connection to the broadcaster.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Confirm that you have entered the right appID at
        <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/broadcast/upload" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
            >https://steamcommunity.com/broadcast/upload</a
        >. The appid is used to connect the stream to the correct game. If the appid is missing, the
        Steam store product page will not show the stream and it will not be featured on the front
        page. You will need to enter the appID and regenerate the RTMP token and enter it into your
        broadcasting software.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="specs"></a>RTMP Streaming Specs</h2>
If your stream is using external software to stream content to Steam, then this section applies. At
this time, Steam requires these encoding specs to be set. If you're having issues with videos
stuttering, pausing, or not playing back correctly, please check the following:<br />
<br />
<strong>Video encoding requirements</strong><br />
<br />
<ul>
    <li>Codec: H.264<br /></li>
    <li>Profile: High<br /></li>
    <li>Level: 4.1<br /></li>
    <li>Frame Rate: 30 FPS or 60 FPS<br /></li>
    <li>Frame Ratio: 16:9<br /></li>
    <li>Keyframe interval: 2 seconds<br /></li>
    <li>Maximum bitrate: 7000 kbps CBR</li>
</ul>
Audio encoding requirements<br />
<ul>
    <li>Codec: AAC-LC<br /></li>
    <li>Maximum bitrate: 128 kbps</li>
</ul>
<br />
<strong>Streaming Software Notes</strong><br />
VMIX: By default, VMIX uses Profile Main and Level 3.0. You must change those settings in order for
VMIX to stream correctly to Steam.
