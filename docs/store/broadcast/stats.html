<h1>Broadcast Viewership Statistics</h1>
After running a live stream on Steam, you may want to collect your viewership stats to determine the
reach of your streaming efforts. By logging in as the account used for streaming, you can visit the
<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/broadcast/history" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
    >broadcast history page</a
>
to see this data. Steam will capture and present to you the maximum concurrent viewers, your total
viewers, average watch time, and total watch time by all viewers.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="1"></a>Concepts</h2>
On the broadcast history page, you will see a table with two type of rows: Broadcast Sessions and
Upload Sessions.<br />
<br />
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Broadcast Session</strong> - This is created by Steam when you first start a live
        stream and will continue to exist for at least 5 minutes after you stop streaming. It tracks
        all users logged in AND not logged in that are either currently watching the stream or have
        watched the stream. Consider the broadcast session as a container for all of your upload
        sessions that will uniquely aggregate all viewership stats.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Upload Session</strong> - This is created every time you establish an upload stream
        with Steam and tracks the continuous video and audio sent to Steam. If your network
        connection is interrupted then the upload session will automatically close. Most modern
        streaming software will automatically establish a new connection to continue streaming. This
        new connection would create a new upload session and it will automatically associate itself
        with an existing broadcast session (if one exists).
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="2"></a>History Table</h2>
The following image is an example of the Broadcast History Table. The first row in this example is
the Broadcast session and it captures the viewership for your live streams. There are also three
additional rows, each of them are different upload sequential upload sessions. Having more than one
upload session means that the underlying streams were interrupted and then re-established prior to
five minutes elapsing. <br />

<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="3"></a>Detail Pages</h2>
By clicking the <strong>Details</strong> found at the end of these rows, it will expand the data
presented to you. The broadcast session will, for example, show you your overall viewership data for
the entire event across all of the sequential upload sessions. This is capturing all unique viewers
across all upload sessions without an interruption longer than 5 minutes.<br />

The upload session will expand to show specifics for one continuous upload stream to Steam. This
includes the video resolution, when the particular stream started and stopped (duration), and
possible error conditions. This will also show a graph for concurrent viewers for the duration of
the upload session.<br />
<br />
Steam will automatically enable transcoding when an upload session has more than 10 concurrent
viewers. Transcoding is the process of taking the same video and making a smaller version of the
video. For example, if your input video stream was 1080p, transcoding will likely create 720p, 480p
and 360p resolution video streams. The smaller video size will improve the overall experience for
users with slower network connection.<br />

<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="4"></a>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>What if my game capsule is missing?</strong> - If you do not see your game capsule
        in the history page, this means that 'AppID' was not setup on the
        <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/broadcast/upload" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
            >broadcast upload page</a
        >. This will prevent the live stream from appearing on the store page and prevent
        appropriate categorization of the stream on Steam Community site.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>How far back does the history go?</strong> - We only show your broadcast data from
        the last 30 days. <br />

        <strong
            >If a single user watches two separate upload sessions, does it count as two
            viewers?</strong
        >
        - While we present concurrent viewers over time with the upload sessions, the actual
        tabulating of unique viewers is done at the broadcast session level. Therefore, if the same
        viewer watches two different upload sessions for the same broadcast session, they would only
        be counted as a single unique viewer.
