Many of these assets you can create yourself with your own design teams. Please send them to Valve
with at least a week lead time so we can give you feedback and for our localization team to have
time. We always translate Steam banners into 28+ languages.

        <ul class="%1$s">
            <li>
                For animated assets, please also provide a seamless looping MP4 and PNG sequence
                without the text and logo. Any text should not be animated so it may be easily
                localized by our team.<br />
            </li>
            <li>
                Aim to have animations around 3 to 5 seconds in length. This helps keep final file
                size down for display on Steam.
                <i><strong>All final exported files must remain under 5MB</strong></i
                >. <br />
            </li>
            <li>
                Do not include animations that have strobe effects which may not be suitable for
                users with photosensitivity epilepsy. <br />
            </li>
            <li>Avoid animations that may induce motion sickness. <br /></li>
            <li>
                Make a seamless loop with your animation. Please be aware that Steam is set to loop
                your animation regardless and this function cannot be turned off. <br />
            </li>
            <li>All animated assets will be exported as Webm and MP4 files without audio.<br /></li>
            <li>
                All text (other than game or developer logos) that expresses a message to users
                (e.g. “now available” or “just updated”) must remain editable so that it can be
                localized:<br />
            </li>
            <li>Text cannot animate, and no effects can animate over top of text.<br /></li>
            <li>Please do not flatten any text into the background or the animation.<br /></li>
            <li>
                When exporting your PNG sequence, or MP4 file, be sure to turn off all text layers
                so that text is not flattened into the background.<br />

            <li>
                All essential information should fit within the green safe zone indicated in the

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="popup"></a>Pop-up Marketing Messages - Standard Formats</h2>
<strong>Usage:</strong> Steam messages pop-up in their own window when Steam starts up, after
exiting a game, or if a long amount of time has passed since the client was last started. Most of
these messages also appear on the front page of Steam store, below top-sellers charts.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Examples:</strong><br />
<br />
<img
    src="https://cdn.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/MidweekDealExample_2025_1_half.jpg"
    alt="MidweekDealExample_2025_1_half.jpg"
    title="MidweekDealExample_2025_1_half.jpg"
/>
<img

    alt="MM_DLC_Fallback.jpg"
    title="MM_DLC_Fallback.jpg"
/>
<img
    src="https://cdn.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/MM_MajorUpdate.jpg"
    alt="MM_MajorUpdate.jpg"
    title="MM_MajorUpdate.jpg"
/><br />
<br />
<strong>Design:</strong> Most pop-up marketing messages use existing game store page capsule
images.<br />
<ul>
    <li>
        Midweek Deals, Weekend Deals, Now Available - these use the game's Main Capsule image<br />
    </li>
    <li>New DLC - these will use the store page Header Capsule image for each of the DLC<br /></li>
    <li>Major Update - these use the Event Cover Image from the update event itself</li>
</ul>
<br />
For best results, please make sure the logo in your game's Main Capsule image is clearly legible,
and avoid additional text. Price and call-to-action button will automatically appear below the
image.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="popup"></a>Pop-up Marketing Messages - For Game Updates</h2>
<strong>Usage:</strong> These are special type of Marketing Message designed to spread the word
about a Major Update or a big in-game event to your game's <i>current</i> owners. These can appear
in the same carousel as standard marketing messages, but they're targeted at a game's owners
(instead of non owners), and they link through to a game's announcement blog post (instead of the
game's Store page). <br />
<br />
<strong>Design:</strong> For best results, please make sure the logo of the update is clearly
legible. The image should be something that clearly represents the new content that is part of your
major update. A call-to-action button will automatically appear below the image, and the name of
your update will automatically appear above the image.<br />

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="popup"></a>Pop-up Marketing Messages - For multi-game events</h2>
If we're running a pop-up message to call out an event that contains multiple products, we'll need a
custom vertical size asset. Here are some examples and details.<br />
<br />
<strong>Examples (with CTAs):</strong><br />
<table>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Regional sale event</td>
            <td>Publisher sale event</td>

            </td>

        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
<br />
<strong>Size:</strong> 570px x 600px, JPEG<br />
<br />
<strong>Design: </strong> For best results, you should include depictions of those products in the
marketing message artwork. Ideally, this should utilize the full capsule image for games so that
both the artwork and the game logo are visible and recognizable. Price and call-to-action button
will automatically appear below the image. If there is any regional logo that needs to be used for
specific regions, please include it in the PSD file.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="spotlight"></a>Spotlight Banner</h2>
<strong>Usage:</strong> Spotlight banners appear near the top of the Steam Home page for specific
promotions such as Midweek or Weekend Deals. These also appear on relevant store hubs such as genre
pages or tag pages.<br />
<br />
<strong>Design:</strong> This banner should focus on just your game art and logo. Spotlight Banners
will automatically have a section rendered below the image with the text describing the type of
promotion (eg. "Weekend Deal") and the end dates of the promo. <br />
<br />
<strong>Size:</strong> 306px x 260px, JPEG<br />

    title="spotlightlocation.PNG"
/>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="takeover"></a>Takeover Banner</h2>
<strong>Usage: </strong>Steam Takeover is used only for the largest of game launches or specific
Publisher Sales. This banner appears at the top of the Steam Store home page.<br />
<br />
<strong>Design: </strong>Steam Takeover images should be simple and eye-catching. Typically the
singular key piece of artwork that represents your brand and your product logo.

<strong>Usage: </strong> The takeunder is typically utilized for events, showcases, and awards show.
This banner appears near the top of the Steam Store home page, just below the Main Capsule
carousel.<br />
<br />
<strong>Design: </strong>Steam Takeunder images should be simple, including the name of the event,
the logo (if relevant), along with the dates of the event. This will be shown as a banner on the
page, so you can use the full dimensions of the asset (no feathered edges).<br />

<strong>Size:</strong> 940px x 150px, PNG<br />

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="salepagebackground"></a>Sale Page Background</h2>
<strong>Usage: </strong>This is the image that appears at the top and background of your sale
page.<br />
<br />
<strong>Design: </strong>Critical content should be placed within the template safe area indicated
by the 940-pixel-wide lime green box. The artwork can bleed out to the sides and down the page as
desired. For example, you can run the background artwork at 1789 pixels width with a gradient fade
to a solid color on the sides and bottom and then set the page background color to match this solid
color in Steamworks.<br />

<strong>Usage: </strong>The Store Page Banner can be set to appear at the top of the store page of
every game listed as part of your event. You can only make use of Store Page Banners if the creators
of every single game included on your sale page are aware of and approve of such a banner. In other
words, it should not surprise any developer that your banner appears on the top of their game's
store page.<br />
<br />
<strong>Design: </strong>Store Page Banner images should be simple and eye-catching. Typically, the
singular key piece of artwork that represents the sale event.<br />
