<h1>Library Assets</h1>

for your product. These assets are displayed in customer's libraries and in the community.

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="3"></a>Visibility</h2>
Note that once uploaded, Library Assets are only visible for applications that have a published
store page on Steam. If your store page is not published, Library Assets will not be visible in the
Steam client.
<h2 class="bb_section">
    <a name="capsule"></a>Library Capsule <span style="color: #ca5029">Required</span>
</h2>
The library capsule is the primary way of presenting your game within the Steam Library, including
on the library overview and within collections.<br />
<br />

    alt="library_capsule_example2.jpg"
    title="library_capsule_example2.jpg"
/><br />
<br />
<strong>Usage:</strong> This image is primarily used in the library overview and collection views.
<br />
<br />
<strong>Design:</strong> This should be graphically-centric and give the user some sense of the
experience. Please use the key art and logo that is being used for any retail boxes or marketing. Do
not include quotes or other strings of text beyond the title of your game. The art should
immediately tell the customer something important about your product. The logo should be easily
legible against the background.<br />
<br />
<strong>Size:</strong> 600px x 900px (an additional half-size 300px x 450px PNG will be
auto-generated from larger file)
<h2 class="bb_section">
    <a name="header"></a>Library Header <span style="color: #ca5029">Required</span>
</h2>
The library header is used in different places within the Steam Client Library.<br />
<br />
<img
    src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/cs2libheader.jpg"
    alt="cs2libheader.jpg"
    title="cs2libheader.jpg"
/><br />
<br />
<strong>Usage:</strong> Appears in various places in the Steam Client Library, including Recent
Games. If not set, then the Store Asset Header Capsule is used.<br />
<br />
<strong>Design:</strong> This image should focus on the branding of your product. For best results,
please use similar artwork to the Library Capsule or Store Asset Header Capsule and make sure the
logo is clearly legible. Do not include quotes or other strings of text beyond the title of your
game. The logo should be easily legible against the background.<br />
<br />
<strong>Size:</strong> 920px x 430px
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="4"></a>Library Details Page</h2>
The hero graphic and the logo are layered and move independently when the page is scrolled, creating
a subtle parallax effect. Consider how the product logo will be placed on top of the hero image
(left bottom corner or centered). You’ll want to ensure the logo is both visible and legible against
the background.
<h2 class="bb_subsection">
    <a name="hero"></a>Library Hero <span style="color: #ca5029">Required</span>
</h2>
<img
    src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/Hero_example.jpg"
    alt="Hero_example.jpg"
    title="Hero_example.jpg"
/><br />
<br />
<strong>Usage:</strong> Appears at the top of a user’s library details page for this product. <br />
<br />
<strong>Design:</strong> This should be a visually rich image that is easily recognizable. For best
results, please use the key art and logo that is being used for any retail boxes or marketing. This
image cannot include any text.<br />
<br />
At the center of the template is a “safe area” of 860px x 380px. This area will remain uncropped
across scaling and resizing of the Steam client window. Artwork should extend across the entire
template, but critical content should be within the safe area. For ex: a main character’s face
should be entirely in the safe area or risk being cropped. <br />
<br />
<strong>Size: </strong>3840px x 1240px (an additional half-size 1920px x 620px PNG will be
auto-generated from larger file)
<h2 class="bb_subsection">
    <a name="logo"></a>Library Logo <span style="color: #ca5029">Required</span>
</h2>
<img
    src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/Logo_example_1.png"
    alt="Logo_example_1.png"
    title="Logo_example_1.png"
/><br />
<br />
<strong>Usage:</strong> Appears at the top of a user’s library details page for this product, placed
on top of the hero graphic. <br />
<br />
<strong>Design:</strong> This image should contain only your game's logo type (your game's title,
rendered in the special font or lettering that you have established) and optionally a logomark (an
icon that stands alongside your game's title) together on a transparent background. Aside from your
game's logotype, there should be no other words in this asset. You should use the best aspect ratio
for your logo, however the logo must be either 1280px wide and/or 720px tall.<br />
<br />
For best results, use the logo that is being used for any retail boxes or marketing. You’ll want to
ensure the logo is both visible and legible against the hero graphic background. The PNG image
should have a transparent background. <br />
<br />
<strong>Size: </strong>Either 1280px wide and/or 720px tall (an additional half-size PNG will be
auto-generated from the larger file based on your logo's aspect ratio).<br />
<br />
After upload, you'll use the preview tool to select the logo's position. Options include: left
bottom corner, centered top, centered middle, and centered bottom.<br />
<br />
<strong>Note:</strong> If a hero graphic and logo are not uploaded, the hero area will display a
screenshot from the store, with the application name text overlaid in the bottom left corner. <br />
<br />
