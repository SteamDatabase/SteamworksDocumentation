client.

<br />
<strong>Usage:</strong> This icon is used when creating desktop shortcuts to launch your
application. We will generate the .ico file if a png image is provided. The Shortcut Icon can also
be used to generate the App Icon on upload, however any alpha will be replaced with solid black.
<br />

<strong>Size:</strong> 256px x 256px or 512px x 512px, ICO or PNG

        Note: To properly display your application icon on macOS desktop shortcuts, you must also
        submit an icon file in ICNS format in the "Mac Icon" asset field. If one is not provided,
        then the shortcut will be created with a default Steam logo icon.<br />

<br />
<strong>Usage:</strong> This image is used to represent your application in compact layouts where
there isn't enough room for a larger capsule. For example, it is used in the library list view,
"favorites" in chat, and notifications across the Steam client, mobile client, and Deck. <br />
<br />
The image is typically seen at a small size, but often on higher resolution screens. <br />
<br />
This icon will not appear properly on your store page until your app is published as 'Coming Soon'
or as fully released.<br />
