<strong>Usage:</strong> This icon is used when creating desktop shortcuts to launch your
application. This icon can be used to supply the community icon and client image if desired.<br />
<br />
<strong>Size:</strong> 32px x 32px ICO. You can also submit an ICO file with multiple sizes to
accommodate scaling on different resolutions.

        Note: To properly display your application icon on macOS desktop shortcuts, you must also
        submit an icon file in ICNS format in the "Mac Icon" asset field. If one is not provided,
        then the shortcut will be created with a default Steam logo icon.<br />

/><br />
<br />
<strong>Usage:</strong> This image is used to represent your application in compact layouts where
there isn't enough room for a larger capsule. For example, it is used in the library list view,
"favorites" in chat, and notifications across the Steam client, mobile client, and Deck. <br />
<br />
The image is typically seen at a small size, but often on higher resolution screens. <br />
<br />
This icon will not appear properly on your store page until your app is published as 'Coming Soon'
or as fully released.<br />
