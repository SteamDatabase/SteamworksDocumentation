<h1>Event Graphical Assets</h1>
When creating and publishing new events using the Steam Event tools, you will be required to supply
a set of graphical assets for your event. These assets are used on the event page, as well as
various places on Steam, including your store page, Community Hub, and in the Steam Library. The
exact location of all communication depends on the type of event, user preferences, and the context
in which the event is displayed.<br />

<br />
<strong>Size:</strong> 800px wide x 450px tall<br />
<strong>Design:</strong> This image should primarily contain the artwork and branding for your
event. Steam will always automatically include your game's name and icon next to the cover image, so
it isn't critical to include your game branding in the cover image (but you may still choose to do
so).<br />
<strong>Usage:</strong> It will appear on your store page in recent announcements, in lists of
events and announcements, and on your game's library detail page. It's used to link to your
event/announcement and may be displayed alongside content from multiple games, so the image should
be clear and recognizable.

<strong>Size:</strong> 1920px wide x 622px tall (please see template file for important notes)<br />
<strong>Design:</strong> Add a rich header image to your detail page to communicate the theme or
essence of your update or announcement.<br />
<strong>Usage:</strong> It will appear on the top of your event, acting to establish your branding
and provide color for the detail views.<br />
