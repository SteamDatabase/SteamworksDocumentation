<strong>Usage:</strong> This appears at the top of the store page, in the 'Recommended For You'
section, in browse views on Big Picture mode, and for Daily Deals if applicable.<br />
<br />
<strong>Design:</strong> For best results, please use the key art and logo that is being used for
any retail boxes or marketing. The art used for them should immediately tell the customer something
important about the game. It should be graphically-centric and give the user some sense of the
game-play. <br />

<br />
<strong>Size:</strong> Please provide '920px x 430px' . Smaller versions will be generated from
this.<br />
<br />
<strong>Note:</strong> Generally, this artwork should not change. If you want to include text about
major game updates, tournaments, or other time-sensitive events on your capsules, then
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/assets/overrides" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"

will allow you to upload bespoke capsule images to market something specific in your game, and then
have those special images automatically expire after a set timespan.

<br />
<strong>Usage:</strong> These are used for various lists throughout Steam. Search results,
top-sellers, new releases, etc. <br />
<br />
<strong>Design:</strong> These are small, so for best results focus on making the
<strong><span style="color: #ca5029">logo clearly legible.</span> </strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Size:</strong> Please provide '462px x 174px' image. From that, two smaller sizes (120x45
and 184x69) capsules are automatically generated.<br />
<br />
<strong>Requirements: </strong>Small Capsule should contain readable logo, even at smallest size. In
most cases, this means
<strong
    ><span style="color: #ca5029">your logo should nearly fill the small capsule.</span>
</strong>
The art in the small capsule <strong>does not</strong> need to be the same as your other capsules
(Main, Header, etc.)<br />
<br />
<strong>Note:</strong> Generally, this artwork should not change. If you want to include text about
major game updates, tournaments, or other time-sensitive events on your capsules, then

<span style="color: #ca5029"
    >Screenshots should exclusively show the gameplay of your game. This means avoiding using
    concept art, pre-rendered cinematic stills, or images showing awards, marketing copy, written
    descriptions, and so on. Please show customers what your game is actually like to play. Menu
    screens should only be included if they are a unique component of your game. Showing the in-game
    UI can be helpful for players to understand how they will be interacting with your game.</span
><br />
<br />
<strong>Usage:</strong> Screenshots are displayed on your store page, and on other pages where your
game may be featured such as the Steam homepage. You must provide at least 5 screenshots of your
product.<br />
<br />
<strong>Design:</strong><br />
<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        Formatting - For best results, please provide screenshots in high-res, widescreen format.
        Any images you upload to the ‘screenshot’ section of your store page should be screenshots
        that show your game. This means avoiding using concept art, pre-rendered cinematic stills,
        or images that contain awards, marketing copy, or written product descriptions. For elements
        such as marketing copy, awards you’d like to show off, or descriptions of your Deluxe
        Edition, please use the specific spaces already available on your store page rather than
        including it in your screenshots.<br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Localizing - To upload localized versions of a screenshot, drag and drop alternative
        versions on to an existing screenshot's thumbnail. Language name can be used as a suffix to
        hint to the UI which language this screenshot should be in (For example,
        foo_japanese.jpg)<br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Age Suitability and Mature Content - By default, your screenshots are
        <strong>not marked</strong> as 'suitable for all ages'. Before you publish your page, you
        should review If your screenshots have suitable content, and if they are suitable for all
        ages, you should mark at least four screenshots as indicated in the picture below. Suitable
        screenshots should not contain gore, violence, or suggestive themes. If you do not mark any
        screenshots as 'suitable for all ages', they may not show on some areas in steam including
        on the front page when you hover over the title art. If you do not have enough screenshots
        flagged, your game may not appear in these places, even if it otherwise qualifies.<br />

<strong>Usage:</strong> This is the image that may be used in the background of your store page.<br />

<strong>Design: </strong>This should be ambient so as not to compete with the content on the page. A

automatically take the last screenshot and generate an appropriate background image from that.<br />

clearly legible.<br />
