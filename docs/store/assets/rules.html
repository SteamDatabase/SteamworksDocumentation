<h1>Graphical Asset Rules</h1>
We want to make sure our guidelines are as clear as possible around what should and shouldn't be
presented on graphical assets, so we've added some rules here that go into effect Sept 1, 2022 and
clarified some existing rules.<br />
<br />

</h2>
Store graphical assets are the banner images (called 'Capsules' in Steamworks) that represent your
game throughout the store. You can find detailed specifications and templates in our
<a href="/doc/store/assets/standard">Store Graphical Assets documentation</a>.<br />
<br />
<ol>
    <li>
        Content on base graphical asset capsules on Steam is limited to game artwork, the game name,
        and any official subtitle. For clarity, this means:<br />
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>No review scores</strong> of any kind, including Steam reviews or external
                news sources<br />
            </li>
            <li><strong>No award names</strong>, symbols, or logos<br /></li>
            <li>
                <strong>No discount marketing copy</strong> (eg. no "On Sale Now" or "Up to 90% off"
                text)<br />
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>No text or imagery promoting a different product</strong>. This includes no
                marketing of sequels or other titles in the same franchise.<br />
            </li>
            <li><strong>No other miscellaneous text</strong>.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
        We understand that partners are excited to talk about large updates and seasonal events, and
        customers are often excited to see these reflected in the game capsules. While this content
        is not allowed in base capsule assets (see rule #1 above), we do support this use case
        through Capsule Artwork Overrides with the following constraints:<br />
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Must use Artwork Overrides</strong> - When including text on a graphical
                asset, this MUST be uploaded as an Artwork Override with a length limit of one
                month.<br />
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Must localize any text</strong> - Any text included on a graphical asset
                MUST be localized into at least the same set of languages supported by the game.<br />
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Only to describe new content</strong> - The only acceptable additional text
                on a game capsule is words describing a major update to the game content, a new
                seasonal event, battle pass, DLC, or similar new content for the game.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
</ol>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="2"></a>Library Graphical Asset Rules</h2>
Library graphical assets are the set of images that represent your game within the Steam library.
These are comprised of a vertical capsule, a hero image and a logo. You can find detailed
specifications and templates in our
<a href="/doc/store/assets/libraryassets">Library Assets documentation</a>. Each of these assets has
slightly different content and uses:<br />
<ol>
    <li>
        <strong>Library Capsule</strong> - this image must include your game logo. It can also
        include your game's subtitle if appropriate. No other text should be present on this
        capsule.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Library Hero</strong> - this image should only contain artwork. There should be no
        words at all in this asset.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Library Logo</strong> - this image is only your game's logotype (your game's title,
        rendered in the special font or lettering that you have established) and optionally a
        logomark (an icon that stands alongside your game's title) together on a transparent
        background. Aside from your game's logotype, there should be no other words in this asset.
    </li>
</ol>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="3"></a>General Graphical Asset Rules</h2>
In addition to the above specific rules, all capsules everywhere on Steam must adhere to these basic
rules:<br />
<ol>
    <li>
        Capsule images must contain a readable product logo/name and have accurate dimensions.<br />
    </li>
    <li>All capsule images (store and library) must have PG-13 appropriate artwork.</li>
</ol>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="4"></a>Example</h2>
What is appropriate use of text on store capsules? Tastefully promoting your recent update or new
content is okay on store capsules, as long as you use a Temporary Artwork Override to do so and
localize the text into languages supported by your game. See rules above for details.<br />

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="5"></a>Store Page Accolades</h2>
We understand that developers want to communicate with their players about the quality of their
games, and Steam already has spaces on game store pages to present most of this information. Press
review quotes, press review scores, and special awards each have dedicated spaces on Steam store
pages where it can be presented consistently and where customers can expect to find that
information. You can check out our
<a href="/doc/store/accolades">Store Page Accolades documentation</a> for details.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="6"></a>Rules Effective Sept 1, 2022</h2>
As a reminder, these <strong>new rules go into effect Sept 1, 2022</strong> and we ask that all game
developers review their graphical assets and make any changes to bring them inline with these new
rules.<br />
<br />
You can review your set of graphical assets by visiting 'edit store' for your game and click the
'graphical assets' tab. Note: check if you have any active
<a href="/doc/store/assets/overrides">Artwork Overrides</a>, as you may need to update those as
well.<br />
<br />
Any game not adhering to these rules may have limits to visibility within the Steam store and will
be ineligible for featuring in official Steam sales and events.<br />
<br />
