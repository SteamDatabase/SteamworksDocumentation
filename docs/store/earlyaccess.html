<h1>Early Access</h1>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Overview</h2>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="2"></a>What Is Early Access?</h2>
Steam Early Access enables you to sell your game on Steam while it is still being developed, and
provides context to customers that a product should be considered "unfinished." Early Access is a
place for games that are in a playable alpha or beta state, are worth the current value of the
playable build, and that you plan to continue to develop for release.<br />
<br />
Releasing a game in Early Access helps set context for prospective customers and provides them with
information about your plans and goals before a "final" release.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="3"></a>What Early Access Is Not</h2>
<strong>Early Access is not a way to crowdfund development of your product.</strong><br />
You should not use Early Access solely to fund development. If you are counting on selling a
specific number of units to complete your game, then you need to think carefully about what it would
mean for you or your team if you don't sell that many units. Are you willing to continue developing
the game without any sales? Are you willing to seek other forms of investment?<br />
<br />
<strong>Early Access is not a pre-purchase</strong><br />
Early Access is not meant to be a form of pre-purchase, but a tool to get your game in front of
Steam users and gather feedback while finishing your game. <br />
<br />
Early Access titles must deliver a playable game or usable software to the customer at the time of
purchase, while pre-purchase games are delivered at a future date. Read more about

>.<br />
<br />
<strong>Steam Early Access is not the same as Advanced Access</strong><br />
Advanced Access on Steam is commonly referred to as "early access" on other platforms, however,
Steam Early Access is a completely different thing. Advanced Access is a Pre-Purchase incentive, in
which customers that Pre-Purchase a "Deluxe" package(s) of your game are given access to the game
earlier than customers that Pre-Purchase the "Standard" (most basic) package. Read more about

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="4"></a>Is Early Access Right For Me?</h2>
Early Access is a tool to develop your game with the community by giving them access to your title
before it is officially released. You should think hard about whether it is a fit for your game. We
recommend looking at other games in Early Access on Steam, checking out the Developer Forums, and
also reading some of the below case studies to learn more about developer experiences with Early
Access:<br />
<br />
During Steam Dev Days, in January 2014, four developers shared what they have learned from being on
Early Access; how it affected their development, their sales, and when does Early Access make
sense.<br />

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="5"></a>Rules</h2>
1.
<strong
    ><i
        >You must include Steam Early Access branding and information about the current state of
        your game on any third-party sites where you are distributing Steam keys for your Early
        Access game.</i
    ></strong
>
We work very hard to make sure that customers understand what they are buying when they get an Early
Access title on Steam, and this expectation continues wherever Steam keys are distributed. You must
include the Steam Early Access branding as well as current information on the state of your game,
and a link to the
<a href="http://store.steampowered.com/earlyaccessfaq/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
    >Steam Early Access FAQ</a
>
on any site where you are selling Steam keys for your Early Access title. Additionally, you should
also include a copy of the Early Access questionnaire. You can read more in the
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/marketing/branding" class="bb_doclink"
    >Steam Branding Guidelines</a
>.<br />
<br />
2. <strong><i>Do not make specific promises about future events.</i> </strong>For example, there is
no way you can know exactly when the game will be finished, that the game will be finished, or that
planned future additions will definitely happen. Do not ask your customers to bet on the future of
your game. Customers should be buying your game based on its current state, not on promises of a
future that may or may not be realized.<br />
<br />
3.<strong>
    <i>Steam Early Access titles need to be available to customers through Steam.</i></strong
>
If Steam enables your Early Access game, we expect you to have the Early Access game available for
sale on the Steam store. Do not offer it for sale on Steam any later than you offer it anywhere
else.<br />
<br />
4.<strong> <i>Don't overcharge Steam customers.</i></strong> The Early Access price of your game
should be no higher than that offered on any other service or website. Please take care of your
customers on Steam.<br />
<br />
5.<strong>
    <i>Make sure you set expectations properly everywhere you talk about your game.</i></strong
>
Be transparent with your community. For example, if you know your updates during Early Access will
break save files, make sure you tell players up front. And say this everywhere you sell your Steam
keys.<br />
<br />
6.<strong> <i>Don't launch in Early Access without a playable game.</i></strong> If you have a tech
demo, but not much gameplay yet, then it’s probably too early to launch in Early Access. If you are
trying to test out a concept and haven't yet figured out what players are going to do in your game
that makes it fun, then it's probably too early. You might want to start by giving out keys to
select fans and getting input from a smaller and focused group before you release in Early Access.
At a bare minimum, you will need a video trailer that shows gameplay. Even if you are asking for
feedback that will impact gameplay, customers need something to start with in order to give informed
feedback and suggestions.<br />
<br />
7. <strong><i>Don't launch in Early Access if you are finished with development.</i> </strong>If you
have all your gameplay defined already and are just looking for final bug testing, then Early Access
isn’t right for you. You’ll probably want to send out some keys to fans or do more internal
playtesting instead. Early Access is intended as a place where customers can impact the final game.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="qanda"></a>Early Access Q&amp;A</h2>
Below are some suggested guidelines for completing the Early Access questionnaire. You know your
product best, so treat the answers below as guidelines. More than anything, you should try to be
detailed and transparent with customers. This is your opportunity to talk about your plans, set
overall expectations, and start the conversation with your community as you work towards a final
release. You may also find it helpful to find inspiration from the products or developers you
admire. <br />
<br />
<i><strong>Why Early Access?</strong></i
><br />
What are your goals? Hopefully you will have the answer to this question before creating your store
page. Early Access is a marathon, not a sprint. Make sure you are ready for the commitment of
continuing to work on your product, receive feedback, and see your project through to completion.
<br />
<strong
    ><i
        ><br />
        Approximately how long will this game be in Early Access?</i
    ></strong
><br />
Be as specific as you can. If you don't have a target date range, explain why.<br />
<br />
<strong><i>How is the full version planned to differ from the Early Access version?</i></strong
><br />
Again, think about your goals. "Full version" means different things for every product, and this is
something only you can decide. Be specific about what you plan on adding, or the data you hope to
collect. Don't worry if you end up changing your mind later - that's the point! If you are
transparent and listen to your community, you'll be in good shape.<br />
<br />
<strong><i>What is the current state of the Early Access version?</i></strong
><br />
What can a customer buy and use today? Be specific in terms of modes, features, levels, etc. You
might need to update this section every few weeks or months, to make sure it reflects your
progress.<br />
<br />
<strong><i>Will the game be priced differently during and after Early Access?</i></strong
><br />
There is no rule on how you price your final product, or official best practice. Many successful
developers have raised the price, and many have ultimately lowered the price. In general, try to
think of things from an Early Access customer's point of view. How would they feel about this
decision. You should aim to reward your early supporters and make them feel like their time and
effort was worth it. That doesn't necessarily mean your Early Access price is lower than your final
release, but try to provide some kind of value to your Early Access community.<br />
<br />
<strong><i>How are you planning on involving the Community in your development process?</i></strong
><br />
The Community plays a crucial role in Early Access development. How will you communicate with your
users? On a forum? Your website? How often? This is your chance to tell your users how they can
shape your product's development.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="6"></a>Enabling Early Access</h2>
These steps need to be taken prior to the release of your game.<br />
<br />
To enable Early Access on your product, complete the following steps:<br />
<ol class="bb_ol">
    <li>
        Check the 'Early Access' checkbox under the 'Early Access' tab in the store page
        configuration area for your product.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Complete the Early Access Q&amp;A. Read more about the Q&amp;A
        <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/earlyaccess#qanda" class="bb_doclink"
            >here</a
        >.
    </li>
</ol>
<br />
Once your product page and Q&amp;A have been completed and reviewed by Valve, you may release your
title in Early Access. For more information on releasing your title, see
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/releasing" class="bb_doclink">Release Process.</a>
<div class="bb_callout">
    <div>
        Note: If you already have a Coming Soon page for your product, you can enable Early Access
        yourself. Your store page will need to be reviewed again prior to release.
    </div>
</div>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="7"></a>Best Practices</h2>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="8"></a>Maintaining your Early Access Store Page</h2>
While it’s fine for games to stay in Early Access as long as necessary, it’s very important for
current and potential players to receive up-to-date information on your development plans. This
means your store page should always reflect:<br />
<ol class="bb_ol">
    <li>The current state of your Early Access game.</li>
    <li>And your most up-to-date plans for an eventual 1.0 release.</li>
</ol>
It’s best to revisit your Early Access store page at least once a year to ensure the information
presented there is still relevant and current. There are several ways you can (and should!) keep
your store page up to date: <br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        <strong><i>Refresh Your Early Access Q&amp;A</i></strong> - To update your answers to your
        player-facing Early Access Q&amp;A, log in to your game in Steamworks, click on 'Edit Store
        Page' &gt; and then the 'Early Access' tab (See above for more details on the Early Access
        Q&amp;A). Don't forget to save and publish!<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong><i>Update your Marketing Materials</i></strong> - If you need to refresh your
        marketing materials to reflect the latest version of your game, log in to Steamworks and
        click on 'Edit Store Page' &gt; and then select the appropriate tabs to update your
        marketing materials as needed. More details on updating your Store page can found
        <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/editing" class="bb_doclink">here</a>.
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong><i>Post a News Event</i></strong> - Do you have a big update to share with your
        community, such as a great new feature or an unexpected delay? If so, you should also
        consider publishing a
        <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc//marketing/event_tools" class="bb_doclink"
            >News Event</a
        >
        to share these details with your current players.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="9"></a>Early Access Pricing</h2>
Pricing decisions depend on the nature of your game and what behavior you'd like to encourage. Most
developers have chosen to start out with lower price than their target launch price. This
establishes a price that is fair for the content being provided at that time, with the intention
that the price will rise over time as more content is added and the game becomes more polished.
<br />
<br />
Conversely, some developers have chosen to set their Early Access price higher than the target
launch price so that they can reach a smaller group of more dedicated fans.<br />
<br />
Note that you will not be able to run a discount within 30 days following a price increase. This
includes a launch discount when your title transitions from Early Access to fully released. If you
have raised your base price within 30 days of this transition you will not be able to run a launch
discount.<br />
<br />
Please see
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/pricing#5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
    >Early Access Pricing FAQ</a
>
for more information.
<div class="bb_callout">
    <div>
        It's important to be transparent to your community about your pricing decisions, especially
        if you plan on raising the price in the future. You may not run a permanent discount while
        in Early Access. If you want to price your title lower in Early Access, you should set a
        lower base price.
    </div>
</div>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="10"></a>Transitioning From Early Access to 'Released'</h2>
When you consider your product "feature complete" and no longer in a significant state of change,
you may transition from Early Access to 'Released.' It is worth noting this does not mean you should
stop adding features or updating your product--you should keep adding content or fixing bugs as is
appropriate for your title.
<div class="bb_callout">
    <div>
        Note: If your product is no longer marked as Early Access, the expectation from customers
        will be that your product is stable and delivers a complete experience.
    </div>
</div>
<br />
When you are ready to remove the Early Access context from around your product, complete the
following steps:<br />
<ol class="bb_ol">
    <li>Upload and publish your updated build of your game or software.<br /></li>
    <li>
        Click 'View Release Options' at the top of your product landing page to prepare and release
        your game fully. Pushing the "Release" button will update the release date for your game,
        remove the Steam Early Access branding from your store page, and apply any launch discount
        you have defined.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        We recommend publishing an announcement on your Community Hub notifying customers that the
        game has been released from Early Access.
    </li>
</ol>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="11"></a>Early Access Marketing and Visibility</h2>
In many ways, Early Access titles are treated the same as "fully released" titles. You will still be
able to run discounts, featured in promotions, and be organically recommended to other customers.
However, you will not receive your full launch visibility until you are fully released. See
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/marketing/visibility" class="bb_doclink"
    >Visibility on Steam</a
>
for more information.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="update_notice"></a>Store page notice about last update</h2>
If it has been more than 12 months (one year) since the developers of a game have updated the game
and posted an 'update' type event to tell players about it, Steam will add a note to the store page,
just above the Developer Questionnaire letting players know that the game has not updated in a
while.<br />
<br />
This notice will appear when either of the following criteria has been met:<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        It has been more than 12 months since a build has been assigned to the 'default' branch in
        Steamworks.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        It has been more than 12 months since the developer has posted an 'update' type event,
        communicating to players about the update (This includes all three 'update' type events:
        Major Update, Regular Update, or Patch Notes)
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="12"></a>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        <h4>Q: Can my unreleased Early Access Game be listed as Coming Soon?</h4>
        <strong>A:</strong> Yes, as long as your product isn't already available for purchase. Once
        you have an Early Access title up for purchase, there is no notion of a product as being
        available to purchase in Early Access and coming soon at the same time. If you want to
        communicate that you will be leaving Early Access soon, use the Early Access Q&amp;A.<br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>
            Q: Once I've released my Early Access game, can I take it down later and go back to a
            Coming Soon state?
        </h4>
        <strong>A:</strong> No, this is not possible. Early Access is for games that will remain
        available and playable as their development continues. If you'd rather temporarily test a
        game build with the option to take it down later, then a
        <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/features/playtest" class="bb_doclink"
            >Steam Playtest</a
        >
        is a better alternative. <br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Q: Is it okay to raise my price after leaving Early Access?</h4>
        <strong>A:</strong> Yes, though if you raise your price, you must wait at least 30 days
        before changing your price again or running a discount. If you increase your price within 30
        days of your transition from Early Access to fully released, your launch discount will not
        apply.<br />
        <br />
        If you're planning on raising your price at or around the time of releasing out of Early
        Access and want to run a discount to celebrate your V1.0 release, you may want to consider
        these scenarios:<br />
        <ul class="bb_ul">
            <li>
                You could leave your price as is, run a discount as you release V1.0 out of Early
                Access and then raise your price after that.<br />
            </li>
            <li>
                You could raise your price as you transition out of Early Access and not run a
                discount.<br />
            </li>
            <li>
                You could raise your price more than 30 days before you release out of Early Access,
                and then run a discount to go with your V1.0 release.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>
            Q: How will my Early Access launch be marketed? Do early access games get visibility on
            the store?
        </h4>
        <strong>A:</strong> Early Access titles are still able to run discounts, be featured in
        promotions, and be organically recommended to other users. Early Access titles do not
        receive the same launch visibility as a v1.0 release. Check the
        <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/marketing/visibility" class="bb_doclink"
            >Visibility on Steam</a
        >
        documentation for more details.<br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Q: Do Early Access titles get "launch visibility"?</h4>
        <strong>A:</strong> Early Access titles will appear in the "All New Releases" tab in the
        Early Access section and if users have your title on their wishlist, they will receive an
        e-mail notification of its Early Access release. Also, Early Access titles may be
        recommended to specific users in various sections of the home page based on those users'
        preferences and tastes, it may appear on the "New and Trending" section on the Early Access
        page if the title is doing well and it can appear on 'top sellers' list on store home page
        and on relevant genre and tag pages if it has achieved sales rank.<br />
        <br />
        Once you're ready to fully release your titles, additional visibility areas apply. More can
        be found in the "Full Release Launch Visibility" section here:

        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Q: How can I make my transition out of Early Access successful?</h4>
        <strong>A:</strong> Whether this is successful depends very heavily on your game and details
        about your game, so it’s very hard to give any sort of generalized advice. Think about
        factors like your game's performance while in Early Access, how satisfied players have been,
        and how much pent up demand there is. If your Early Access experience was already very
        polished &amp; satisfying, there may not be a lot of pent up demand and therefore you may
        not see a big spike on launch without doing a larger launch campaign or huge difference in
        quality of the game on launch, it would simply be reflected in steady sales over time.
        You’ll probably be able to estimate your Early Access to 1.0 exit better than anyone else,
        because you know how you’ve been using Early Access best.<br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Q: I forgot to enable Early Access, what do I do?</h4>
        <strong>A:</strong> If you already have a Coming Soon page for your product, you can enable
        Early Access yourself. Your store page will need to be reviewed again prior to release. If
        your game is already released, then it's not possible for a game to move backwards from
        "Released" to "Early Access". Steam has different launch visibility, displays, and reviews
        for when a game starts in Early Access. If you wish to communicate details about your
        development plans, please use the Community Hub (a pinned post can be very helpful) or
        consider adding the relevant information to the About The Game display section.<br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Q: Once my game is released in Early Access, can I set my V1.0 launch date?</h4>
        <strong>A:</strong> There is not a specific field for you to enter your intended full
        release date (V1.0 release date). However, you can create an
        <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/marketing/event_tools" class="bb_doclink"
            >Announcement</a
        >
        with your intended release information, including the date and any upcoming updates that
        will ship with V1.0. <br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Q: What happens if I don't complete my Early Access game?</h4>
        <strong>A:</strong> Sometimes things don't work out as you planned, and you may need to
        discontinue development of your Early Access game before you are ready for a V1.0 release.
        If this happens, you can contact Valve to figure out the next steps. There are two options:
        <br />
        <br />
        If your Early Access game is playable and well received, but you're unable to develop it to
        the point where you feel it warrants a full V1.0 release, then we can keep your game on the
        Store, but otherwise remove it from Early Access. This will remove the Early Access tag and
        Early Access Q&amp;A displayed on your game’s Store Page, but not start the launch
        visibility that comes with definitively releasing your game out of Early Access. This would
        be a permanent change; we aren’t able to reenable Early Access again later, so please
        consider this option carefully before
        <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
            >contacting us</a
        >
        with the details. In this case, you should let your community know about your decision to
        leave Early Access via a forum post or news event. <br />
        <br />
        Alternatively, we can remove your Early Access game from Steam. Before reaching out, you
        should read about the
        <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/retire_app" class="bb_doclink"
            >process of removing a game from Steam</a
        >
        and take a moment to carefully consider whether or not pulling your game down is actually
        the right choice. Are you acting based on an emotional response to negative feedback, or is
        retiring your game the appropriate next step? We take our relationship with customers
        seriously, so if you choose to cancel development of a game and retire it from the store, we
        will not republish it again later and we may offer refunds to any users who purchased it.
        Treating customers fairly is the most important thing to us.
