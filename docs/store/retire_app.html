<h1>Removing a product from Steam</h1>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Overview</h2>
If you need to stop selling your product for some reason, Valve can help you
make the necessary changes. This documentation will be helpful if you are
cancelling or retiring a game, or if you have lost distribution rights and need
to stop selling a title. Our biggest priority is making sure customers are
treated fairly, so please follow the steps outlined below.<br /><br />Before
reaching out, take a moment to carefully consider whether or not pulling your
game down is actually the right choice. Are you acting based on an emotional
response to negative feedback, or is retiring your game the appropriate next
step? We take our relationship with customers seriously, so if you choose to
cancel development of a game and retire it from the store, we will not republish
it again later and we may offer refunds to any users who purchased it.

    - When you contact us, please provide as much background as possible. How we
    handle the situation depends on context- how long have you been selling the
    game? Why do you need to stop selling it? Does it rely on servers or other
    functions that customers will no longer be able to access? Did you lose the
    rights to distribute the game? What is your timeline? Once you contact
    Valve, we’ll hide the purchase option and take other appropriate steps as
    needed.<br />

    - If your title is no longer sold on Steam, it should also be retired from
    any other stores where you sell Steam keys, including retail and your own
    website. It’s not OK to continue selling Steam keys if the game is no longer
    listed on the Steam store. You will need to get a list of unsold keys from
    each of your retailers and ban them using the

    <strong>Communicate the change to your customers</strong> - It’s important
    to explain the situation to your customers. Don’t make promises you can’t
    keep, but do let your users know what to expect, especially if your game
    relies on hosted servers that customers will no longer be able to access.

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="3"></a>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<strong>Q: What about Free to Play games?</strong><br />A: Treating customers
fairly is the most important thing to us, so we ask that you give your customers
at least 90 days notice before retiring a Free to Play game. You should disable
any in-game purchasing, and contact us following the instructions above. Our
hope is that customers have fair warning and get a chance to use up any
remaining in-game currency or items before your game goes offline.<br /><br /><br /><strong
  >Q: What about refunds?</strong
><br />A: All purchases are covered by the normal Steam refund policy. In some
cases, we may choose to extend the option to customers to refund beyond the
normal policy, for instance if a new game is cancelled or some promised content
or features are not delivered. We may offer refunds to Free-to-Play customers if
they haven’t had the opportunity to get value out of their in-game purchases.<br /><br /><br /><strong
  >Q: What if I need to temporarily disable purchases or new installs of my
  game?</strong
><br />A: If your game is in a state where you simply can’t handle more new
customers, such as overloaded game servers, we can temporarily hide the purchase
or play option on your store page. Please follow the steps above as appropriate
in contacting Valve.<br /><br /><strong
  >Q. What happens to a retired game for the players of that game?</strong
><br />A: Retired games will remain in players' Steam libraries. Those players
will continue to be able to download, install, and launch the game. The Steam
Community remains visible and accessible for players to post and share in. The
store page for the game remains accessible, but is removed from listings in the
store.
