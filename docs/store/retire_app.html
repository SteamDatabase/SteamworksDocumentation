<h1>Removing a product from Steam</h1>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Overview</h2>
If you need to stop selling your product for some reason, Valve can help you make the necessary
changes. This documentation will be helpful if you are cancelling or retiring a game, or if you have
lost distribution rights and need to stop selling a title. Our biggest priority is making sure
customers are treated fairly, so please follow the steps outlined below.<br />
<br />
Before reaching out, take a moment to carefully consider whether or not pulling your game down is
actually the right choice. Are you acting based on an emotional response to negative feedback, or is
retiring your game the appropriate next step? We take our relationship with customers seriously, so
if you choose to cancel development of a game and retire it from the store, we will not republish it
again later and we may offer refunds to any users who purchased it.

            <li>Did you lose the rights to distribute the game? <br /></li>
            <li>Have you announced the change to your community yet?<br /></li>
            <li>What is your timeline?</li>
        </ol>
        Once you contact Valve, we’ll hide the purchase option and take other appropriate steps as

    <li>
        <strong>Contact other retailers if you sell your product via Steam key</strong> - If your
        title is no longer sold on Steam, it should also be retired from any other stores where you
        sell Steam keys, including retail and your own website. It’s not OK to continue selling
        Steam keys if the game is no longer listed on the Steam store. You will need to get a list
        of unsold keys from each of your retailers and ban them using the
        <a href="/partnerbatchbancdkeys/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Ban CD Key Tool</a><br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Communicate the change to your customers</strong> - It’s important to explain the
        situation to your customers. Don’t make promises you can’t keep, but do let your users know
        what to expect, especially if your game relies on hosted servers that customers will no
        longer be able to access.

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="3"></a>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<strong>Q: What about Free to Play games?</strong><br />
A: Treating customers fairly is the most important thing to us, so we ask that you give your
customers at least 90 days notice before retiring a Free to Play game. You should disable any
in-game purchasing, and contact us following the instructions above. Our hope is that customers have
fair warning and get a chance to use up any remaining in-game currency or items before your game
goes offline.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Q: What about refunds?</strong><br />
A: All purchases are covered by the normal Steam refund policy. In some cases, we may choose to
extend the option to customers to refund beyond the normal policy, for instance if a new game is
cancelled or some promised content or features are not delivered. We may offer refunds to
Free-to-Play customers if they haven’t had the opportunity to get value out of their in-game
purchases.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Q: What if I need to temporarily disable purchases or new installs of my game?</strong
><br />
A: If your game is in a state where you simply can’t handle more new customers, such as overloaded
game servers, we can temporarily hide the purchase or play option on your store page. Please follow
the steps above as appropriate in contacting Valve.<br />
<br />
<strong>Q. What happens to a retired game for the players of that game?</strong><br />
A: Retired games will remain in players' Steam libraries. Those players will continue to be able to
download, install, and launch the game. The Steam Community remains visible and accessible for
players to post and share in. The store page for the game remains accessible, but is removed from
listings in the store.<br />
