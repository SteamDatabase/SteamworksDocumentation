        <h5>In Brief</h5>
        Post news and game reviews through your Steam Curator or developer homepage automatically
        from content in an RSS feed.
        <h5>Level of integration</h5>
        Requires a one-time set up in Steam and the creation of a regularly updated RSS feed
        generated by your own content management system.

Setting up an RSS feed allows you to streamline posting news, updates, or reviews from your existing
content management platform. You can choose to have Steam automatically post each item in your feed,
or you can use it to quickly import your feed content to manually edit before posting.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="1"></a>Requirements</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        If you are a developer or publisher, you'll need to have a homepage set up on Steam.
        Instructions can be found <a href="/doc//store/creator_homepage">here</a>.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        If you are press, video content creator, reviewer, or other form of influencer, you'll need
        to set up a Steam Curator. Instructions can be found
        <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/about/curators/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
            >here</a
        >.<br />
    </li>
    <li>Valve will need to enable the RSS feature for your Curator or Developer homepage.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="2"></a>Getting Set Up</h2>
To insert your RSS feed, start by visiting your Steam Curator or Developer Homepage on Steam and
select the 'admin' tab. In the left list of options, select the new option labeled "Manage my RSS
Feeds". Then you will see a field for you to type or paste in your RSS feed URL and see a preview
list of posts generated from that feed.<br />
<br />
Hit 'save' to save your RSS feed URL.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="3"></a>Automatic Posting</h2>
If you enable the option to automatically post from your rss feed, Steam will check your feed every
five minutes and automatically post any new articles that appear.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="4"></a>Manual Posting</h2>
You may also choose to leave automatic posting turned off and you can post each desired item
individually. From your list of RSS posts, you can simply click "Post This Item" and choose whether
to stage it as a draft to edit prior to posting, or to post immediately.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="5"></a>Post Visibility</h2>
The content from your feed will automatically appear in these locations:<br />
<ul>
    <li>
        Posts will appear on
        <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/newshub/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
            >Steam News Hub</a
        >
        to players that follow your Steam Curator or Developer Homepage.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Posts will appear to anyone that visits your Steam Curator page or Developer Homepage.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Posts will appear to to anyone that navigates to /newshub/group/&lt;clanid&gt; (by clicking
        'view all' from the curator's page)<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Posts tagged with game appIDs will appear within those games' news feed for players that
        follow your Steam Curator or Developer Homepage.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="6"></a>Testing Your RSS Feed</h2>
Enter the URL to your RSS feed. It will automatically generate a preview of posts extracted from the
feed below. You may preview individual posts.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="7"></a>Updating Public Posts</h2>
Once Steam has posted an item from your feed, you can choose to update that item within the Events
&amp; Announcements tools in Steam, or on your content management system that generates the rss
feed. Steam will detect the updated content in your rss feed and overwrite the original post made on
Steam.<br />
<br />
Note that changes made to a post in your rss feed will overwrite the values saved on Steam.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="8"></a>RSS XML Fields</h2>
Steam can make use of the following fields. Anything else will be ignored.<br />
<ul>
    <li><strong>Title</strong><br /></li>
    <li><strong>Description</strong><br /></li>
    <li><strong>Link </strong>(used as the URL to redirect users to read more…)<br /></li>
    <li><strong>Author </strong> (stored but not used)<br /></li>
    <li>
        <strong>Date </strong> used as the date of the article. The later of pubDate or Date field
        found in the document will be used per post. See below for date format<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>pubDate</strong> used as the date of the article. Later of pubDate or Date field
        found in the document will be used per post. See below for date format<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Optional: <strong>steam:appid</strong> to indicate which app specific hub we should surface
        the information about. To get the appid for a game, just visit the game's store page in your
        browser and copy the set of numbers from the url<br />
        <img
            src="https://cdn.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/rss_appid.jpg"
            alt="rss_appid.jpg"
            title="rss_appid.jpg"
        /><br />
        (NOTE: if you are posting about DLC, a demo, or a soundtrack, please use the appID for the
        full game. Using the appID for DLC, demo, or soundtrack will have no effect)
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="date"></a>Date Format Supported</h2>
Steam will parse dates written in RFC 822 format or dates written in ISO-8601 format with the
assumed GMT time zone. Note that the RSS standard indicates that the dates should be written in
<a href="https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc822/#z28" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">RFC-822</a>
format. <br />
<br />
Date and time that are provided must be in the past. It is assumed that any post found within the
RSS or Atom feed is immediately visible and publishable by Steam. We will reject articles with
future date or times. Note that the date specified cannot be earlier than Sep 12, 2003. <br />
<br />
Example RFC 822 Dates: <br />
Tue, 26 May 2020 23:26:48 +0100<br />
Tue, 26 May 2020 23:26:48 PST<br />
<br />
Example of ISO-8601 with GMT Time zone:<br />

    your full on article about a game, or can be a portion of the article with a pretty picture.
    &lt;img width="1920" height="1080" src="https://www.yourwebsite.com"/&gt; It can have images,
    video and &lt;a href="https://www.yourwebsite.com"&gt;links&lt;/a&gt;. ]]&gt;
    &lt;/description&gt; &lt;steam:subtitle&gt;A short subtitle (Max 120 characters) that appears at
    the top of a post when viewing the full post contents&lt;/steam:subtitle&gt;
    &lt;steam:summary&gt;A short summary (Max 180 characters) that appears when a post is presented
    in a list &lt;/steam:summary&gt; &lt;steam:appids&gt; &lt;steam:appid&gt;220&lt;/steam:appid&gt;

    &lt;steam:recommendation_blurb&gt;This is the short (Max 200 characters) recommendation or
    review text for the game&lt;/steam:recommendation_blurb&gt; &lt;/item&gt; &lt;/channel&gt;
    &lt;/rss&gt;
</div>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="10"></a>Extended Support limited ATOM format:</h2>
<br />
Once in a while, RSS and ATOM formats get interchanged. There is limited support for ATOM specific
elements. We support all of the Steam specific XML within an ATOM entry. Here is an example of
supported ATOM elements without any Steam specific elements:<br />
<br />
<div class="bb_code xml">
    &lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt; &lt;feed xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom"
    xml:lang="en"&gt; &lt;title&gt;Test Site&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;icon&gt;https://store.steampowered.com/newshub/logo_32x32.png&lt;/icon&gt;
    &lt;updated&gt;2020-07-01T10:27:45-04:00&lt;/updated&gt; &lt;entry&gt;
    &lt;published&gt;2020-07-01T10:27:45-04:00&lt;/published&gt;
    &lt;updated&gt;2020-07-01T10:27:45-04:00&lt;/updated&gt; &lt;title&gt;Test Title for
    Post&lt;/title&gt; &lt;content type="html"&gt; &lt;img alt=""
    src="https://store.steampowered.com/images/logo.jpg" /&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is the main post
    contents.&lt;/p&gt; It's usually your full on article about a game, or can be a portion of the
    article with a pretty picture. &lt;img width="1920" height="1080"
    src="https://www.yourwebsite.com"/&gt; It can have images, video and &lt;a
    href="https://www.yourwebsite.com"&gt;links&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/content&gt; &lt;link rel="alternate"
    type="text/html" href="https://www.yourwebsite.com/specific/article_for_this_rss"/&gt;
    &lt;author&gt; &lt;name&gt;Gordon Freeman&lt;/name&gt; &lt;/author&gt; &lt;/entry&gt;
    &lt;/feed&gt;
</div>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="11"></a>Supported HTML / Formatting</h2>
Within the 'description' field, you can use the following html tags for formatting:<br />
<div class="bb_code html">
    &lt;a href="foo"&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Bold&lt;/b&gt; or
    &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;i&gt;Italic&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
    &lt;u&gt;Underline&lt;/u&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;List Item&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ordered List Item&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;Paragraph&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img
    src="foo"&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Heading 1&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Heading 2&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Heading
    3&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;hr&gt; &lt;iframe
    src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClPgQMi_h8c"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;table&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;&lt;td&gt;Table header cell&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/th&gt; &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Table
    cell&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/table&gt;
</div>
Any other html will likely have unexpected results.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="12"></a>Images</h2>
The RSS feed parser will automatically pull in the first &lt;img&gt; that it finds in your post and
use that image when displaying your post within Steam. These images will be shown at a maximum of
800px wide and can be whatever aspect ratio you wish.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="13"></a>Acceptable content</h2>
Our general expectation is that players will be much more receptive to news about games that are
available on Steam as well as general PC gaming news (hardware, services, etc.). <br />
<ul>
    <li>
        For PC games available on Steam, you can include the appID so that players can filter out
        news about specific games if they wish.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        For items that relate to PC gaming in general and not about a specific game, you can
        obviously leave the appID fields blank.
    </li>
</ul>
<br />
Players will likely be much less excited to find news about non-PC platforms and games that are
exclusively not on Steam, so we’d prefer to steer clear of those topics in news posted to Steam.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="14"></a>Posting Curator Reviews from RSS</h2>
You can use your RSS feed contents to automatically generate reviews for games via Steam Curator
system. Please see <a href="/doc/marketing/curators">Curators &amp; Curator Connect</a> for more
details on setting up a Steam Curator.<br />
<br />
Simply use the item markup within your post item description to express the game it is reviewing,
some metadata and your review text.<br />
<div class="bb_code xml">
    &lt;steam:appids&gt; &lt;steam:appid&gt;220&lt;/steam:appid&gt; &lt;/steam:appids&gt;
    &lt;steam:recommendation&gt;yes&lt;/steam:recommendation&gt;
    &lt;steam:received_for_free&gt;yes&lt;/steam:received_for_free&gt;
    &lt;steam:received_compensation&gt;no&lt;/steam:received_compensation&gt;
    &lt;steam:recommendation_blurb&gt;This is the really short recommendation text for the
    game&lt;/steam:recommendation_blurb&gt;
</div>
<br />
The field for recommendation can support the following values<br />
<div class="bb_code xml">&lt;steam:recommendation&gt;yes|no|info&lt;/steam:recommendation&gt;</div>
<br />
When you post an item automatically from your RSS feed, or manually by clicking "Post This Item", it
will generate a Curator recommendation from the metadata and make that post live as well.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="15"></a>Steam Curator visibility</h2>
Within the Steam News hub, there will be a couple of ways that players can discover your Steam
Curator and choose to follow you for news. We're still working out the details, but it will allow
players to find news sources in their native language. You can also direct your existing readership
to follow you on Steam to get news blurbs in their News Hub.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="16"></a>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
