<h1>Promo Event Tools, Rules, and Guidelines</h1>
Steam has a set of tools for creating and configuring a custom sale landing page that you can use to
highlight games for a special sale, game festival, or digital companion for a physical convention.
This feature needs to be enabled by Valve for your developer or curator group.<br />
<br />
Please read carefully the rules and guidelines below and look for instructions for how to proceed.
