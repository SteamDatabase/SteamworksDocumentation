        <h5>In Brief</h5>
        Set up a page with information about your game to start building an audience and giving
        players a place to learn more and add to their wishlist.
        <h5>Level of integration</h5>
        You'll need a set of branding images, written description, and ideally a gameplay trailer.

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Overview</h2>
You can put up a Coming Soon page for your product well in advance of your release date. This way,
you can let customers know the title is coming to Steam and start building an audience and
excitement around your product. For new products, you must have a Coming Soon page up for at least
two weeks before releasing.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="2"></a>Timing</h2>
It is recommended that you publish your Coming Soon page as soon as you are ready to start talking
publicly about your game. When you post information about your game, you can use your Coming Soon
page on Steam to start collecting feedback and let customers add your game to their
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/marketing/wishlist" class="bb_doclink">Wishlist</a
>.<br />
<br />
Some things to consider:<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        You may want to wait to start showing off your game publicly until you are pretty confident
        on your art direction and core feature set. If the game has potential to change a lot
        between when you start showing it off and release, then players who add it to their wishlist
        early may be confused.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        There doesn't appear to be a strong downside to having a store page up for a long time ahead
        of release, unless the game changes a lot during that time period. Players who wishlist your
        game two years ahead of release can be just as likely to purchase as someone who wishlisted
        two weeks ahead of release.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="3"></a>Benefits</h2>
Once your store page is visible to customers, it can help you build awareness for your product and
generate excitement among potential customers. As soon as you have product branding, screenshots,
and a description of your game, you can put up a 'Coming Soon' page to start utilizing the tools
available on Steam. And you can update your store page whenever you need to once it's live.<br />
<br />
<strong>Activates Community Hub:</strong> Once your store page is visible to customers, it will also
enable the Community Hub. This gives you a place to post announcements, share artwork, and gives
your audience a place to share their enthusiasm and discuss your upcoming release.<br />
<br />
<strong>Allows for Wishlists:</strong> Once your store page is visible to customers, interested
people can start adding your title to their wishlist. Once you reach your release date and hit the
'release' button, Steam will automatically send an e-mail to those people with your game on their
Steam Wishlist.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="4"></a>Getting Set Up</h2>
<strong>Preparing:</strong> To post your page as Coming Soon, you will first need to create a new
application, complete your release checklist and have your page reviewed and approved by Valve. To
do this, click "Create New App..." on your Steamworks dashboard and then follow the checklist on
your product landing page. Everything in the "Your Store Presence" section is required prior to
posting your store page.<br />
<br />
<strong>Getting Reviewed:</strong> Once you have your checklist complete, you'll need to hit the
"Mark As Ready For Review" button in the top section of your product landing page. This will make
your product visible to Valve for review and approval prior to release.<br />
<br />
<strong>Posting:</strong> Once your page has been approved, you will need to click the green "Post
as Coming Soon" button for it to show up publicly as coming soon.<br />
