<h1>Season Passes</h1>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>What is a Season Pass?</h2>
<br />
A Season Pass is a pack of current and future content (DLC) that customers can buy with a single
purchase. All of the DLC included in a Season Pass and each DLC's release timing will be displayed
on the Season Pass store page. As content is released, customers who have purchased the Season Pass
will gain access immediately.<br />
<br />
<strong
    >By offering a Season Pass, you are promising future content. In the process of launching a
    Season Pass you will be asked to commit to a launch timing for each content release in the
    Season Pass. That launch timing is a commitment to both customers and Steam.<br />
    <br />
    If you aren't ready to clearly communicate about the content included in each DLC AND when each
    DLC will be ready for launch, you shouldn't offer a Season Pass on Steam.</strong
><br />
<br />
Selling a Season Pass has risks; since you are promising the release of future content, you have to
commit to completing that content on time. If customers don't like the content you're releasing in
the Season Pass or the timing of that content release, that will be reflected in sales and
reviews.<br />
<br />
Because a Season Pass is effectively a DLC pre-purchase, creating a Season Pass on Steam has many of
the considerations and restrictions as outlined in the documentation on
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/prepurchase" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
    >pre-purchases</a
>. For these reasons, we will not offer a Season Pass except in a few rare cases with partners with
which we have a well-established relationship and that have a proven track record on Steam.
<div class="bb_callout">
    <div>
        If you're considering offering a Season Pass for your game, it's a good idea to think about
        whether there's a customer benefit to buying the Season Pass. In exchange for buying the
        Season Pass upfront, a customer might benefit from a lower overall price on all the content,
        or extra content thrown in for free. Without a benefit, customers won't have much incentive
        to purchase a Season Pass.
    </div>
</div>
<br />
NOTE: All content added to a Season Pass <u>must pay to the same partner</u>.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="2"></a>Season Pass Guidelines</h2>
<br />
When a Season Pass is made available for purchase on Steam, it must include the following
information:<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        A complete list of all DLC included in the Pass. (e.g. listing each of the four DLCs
        included in a Pass).<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        A basic description of the content that’s included in each DLC. For example, the first
        content release might be “The Glitterlands Expansion – New area to explore, two new weapons,
        and new enemies.” It’s not required for the DLC to have a final name at the launch of the
        Season Pass. The information about the content in the DLC doesn’t need to be detailed
        (simply “new weapons” or “two new weapons” is acceptable, they don’t have to list the exact
        weapons).<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Expected release date for each DLC. Quarter and Year (e.g. January to March 2025) or
        Season/Year is acceptable. Of course, a date that’s more precise is also fine (e.g. June,
        2025 or June 1st, 2025).
    </li>
</ul>
<br />
<u>A Season Pass must include at least one released DLC when it is made available for purchase*</u
><br />
*with the exception of Season Passes included in a Pre-Purchase of a deluxe edition.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="3"></a>Delaying or cancelling a DLC in a Season Pass</h2>
<br />
We understand that game development doesn't always go as planned. If you think you aren't going to
be able to release a DLC into the Season Pass by the quarter you promised, we allow you to
self-reschedule the release date one time only during the Season Pass. You can pick a new date up to
3 months later than you originally selected. If for some reason you need to delay more than that,
please
<a
    href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/wizard/HelpWithPublishing"
    target="_blank"
    rel="noreferrer"
    >reach out to us directly</a
>.<br />
<br />
If you cancel a DLC in a Season Pass, customers will be offered a refund for the value of unreleased
DLC.
<div class="bb_callout">
    <div>
        NOTE: Under the Steam Distribution Agreement you have provided a warranty to Valve that your
        DLC will conform in all respects to the descriptions provided to customers, including
        promised release dates. <br />
        <br />
        Even if there has not yet been a customer complaint, Valve may take action if you delay a
        DLC more than a quarter (3 months) beyond the release window you originally promised.<br />
        <br />
        Actions include removing the Season Pass from sale on Steam, refunding all customers who
        purchased the Season Pass for the value of unreleased DLC, or allowing customers the option
        of refunding the entire Season Pass. For the purposes of refunds, the value of unreleased
        DLC will be decided in discussion with Valve. <br />
        <br />
        Valve may also take action if your Season Pass content is not released after one year has
        passed. Actions may include refunds to customers and removing the Season Pass from sale on
        Steam.
    </div>
</div>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="4"></a>Including a Season Pass in a Pre-Purchase</h2>
<br />
You may include a Season Pass as part of a game's pre-purchase. If you'd like to include a Season
Pass as part of a pre-purchase of an edition of a game, you'll still need to set up a Season Pass
DLC as usual. However, as part of setting up a pre-purchase, you'll need to contact Steam to set the
Season Pass DLC into pre-purchase mode. <br />
<br />
When a Season Pass DLC is in pre-purchase mode, you are not required to release at least one DLC in
the Season Pass at the time it goes on sale (as you are usually required to do when you launch a
Season Pass). However, when the game launches, you will need to release the Season Pass out of
pre-purchase--this will entail releasing at least one of the DLCs included in the Season Pass.
<h2 class="bb_section">
    <a name="5"></a>Including a Season Pass in a Deluxe/Premium Edition of Your Game
</h2>
<br />
You can include a Season Pass in a Deluxe or other premium edition of your game. <br />
<br />
To do this, you'll need to create the Season Pass DLC using the same steps outlined in this
documentation page. Once it has been created, you can add the Season Pass DLC app to the Deluxe
package.<br />
<br />
<strong
    >You must ALSO add all of the individual DLCs contained in the Season Pass as they are
    released.</strong
><br />
<br />
This is very important, because if you don't add the individual DLCs to the package (in addition to
the Season Pass) customers won't gain access to the DLCs they purchased in this Deluxe edition when
they are released.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="6"></a>Season Pass Setup</h2>
<br />
Creating a Season Pass is a little more complicated than setting up a regular DLC, and extra steps
are involved in its creation.<br />
<br />
<ol class="bb_ol">
    <li>
        <strong>Create a new DLC App ID</strong> - Create a new DLC for your game.<br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Enable Season Pass on DLC</strong> - On your App Landing Page for the DLC that you
        want to convert into a Season Pass, click on "Enable Season Pass on DLC". Alternatively,
        this step may have been done for you. When a DLC is converted to a Season Pass, additional
        steps are added to the pre-release checklist to ensure that the Season Pass is ready for
        launch.<br />
        <br />
        Any DLC apps that you want available and playable in the Season Pass at the time it releases
        (aka “Day 1” DLC) should be added to the Season Pass’s package during set up. Please be
        aware that at least one DLC must launch with the Season Pass, with the exception of Season
        Passes offered as part of deluxe editions in pre-purchase.<br />
        <br />
        Future DLC apps can be added to the Season Pass’s package later (see below).
        <strong
            >IMPORTANT: In some cases you may be prevented from adding DLC to a Season Pass package.
            If that happens, please reach out to Steam Support for assistance.</strong
        ><br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Edit and detail your Season Pass</strong> – Navigate to the App Landing Page for
        your Season Pass DLC and click on Edit Store Page. From there, navigate to the DLC
        Description tab, where you will find a section at the top of the page called Season Pass
        Roadmap Description.<br />
        <br />
        <img
            src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/SeasonPassNew01.JPG"
            alt="SeasonPassNew01.JPG"
            title="SeasonPassNew01.JPG"
        /><br />
        <br />
        Here, you can hit the Create New Content Release button to set up a new content release for
        your game. <br />
        <br />
        <img
            src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/SeasonPassNew02.JPG"

            title="SeasonPassNew02.JPG"
        /><br />
        <br />
        In the Content Release Title (Public) field, you'll enter the public name for your DLC
        content. This is the public-facing name for your DLC. For example, "The Glitterlands
        Expansion". This doesn’t have to be a full product reveal for each piece of DLC – it’s fine
        if the full reveal comes later – but your Roadmap should give customers a good sense of the
        scope and timeline of all the content they’re purchasing via the Season Pass.<br />
        <br />
        In the Content Release Description (Public), you should enter a text description of the DLC.
        You can also add supporting images. This information is public and customer-facing, so think
        about this as an opportunity to get customers interested in the content. If your description
        doesn't include information on what is included in the DLC, or lacks sufficient detail, your
        Season Pass release may be rejected and you'll have an opportunity to address it.<br />
        <br />
        <u>Please remember to localize your description into the languages you support.</u><br />
        <br />
        Next, you'll select the Intended Release Date for this content. This date is used to set
        reminders on your internal Steamworks dashboard. Please use your local time zone.<br />
        <br />
        In the Publicly Shown Release Date section, you choose the release date that customers will
        see for this piece of content. You can select an exact date, or release month, or present it
        as a release window (for example, January 1st to March 30th).<br />
        <br />
        When you are ready, click "Create".<br />
        <br />
        <img

            alt="SeasonPassNew05.JPG"
            title="SeasonPassNew05.JPG"
        /><br />
        <br />
        Now, you should see the new content release on your Roadmap. You'll also see an option to
        "Mark as Released". See the section below for more information on this step.<br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Allow extra time for Store Page review</strong> - Store Page review can take up to
        3-5 business days, but we recommend budgeting at least 7 days for a Season Pass store page
        review.<br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Launch content into your Season Pass</strong> – Once you have passed review, If your
        content release is a DLC, you can release it normally whenever you are ready. The same
        applies to content releases that are in-game updates; you can update your game with the
        content at any time.<br />
        <br />
        Once the new DLC has been released, you'll need to add the DLC app to the Season Pass
        package.<br />
        <br />
        Navigate to your Season Pass app landing page, and click on the store package for your
        Season Pass.<br />
        <br />

            title="AddPackage.JPG"
        /><br />
        <br />
        Next, add the DLC to your Season Pass package by clicking + Add Applications.<br />
        <br />
        <img
            src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/AddPackage2.JPG"

            title="AddPackage2.JPG"
        /><br />
        <br />
        Search for the DLC application in the field provided*.<br />
        *In some cases you may be prevented from adding DLC to a Season Pass package. If that
        happens, please reach out to Steam Support for assistance.<br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>IMPORTANT: </strong>Once you have released your Season Pass content (via DLC or
        in-game update), you need to return to your Season Pass Roadmap and click on Mark as
        Released.<br />
        <br />
        At this point, if you haven't already, you have the option to link your DLC app ID to the
        content release so that customers who are viewing your Season Pass can click on individual
        DLCs to view their store page.<br />
        <br />
        You will also need to indicate if your DLC was...<br />
        <br />
        <ul class="bb_ul">
            <li>
                Released as an update to the base game (in which case you'll need to make sure you
                are checking for ownership of the Season Pass)<br />
            </li>
            <li>
                Released as a DLC with a store page (as a standard DLC launch with store
                presence)<br />
            </li>
            <li>
                Released as a hidden DLC without a store page. Please only select this option if you
                are sure. Releasing a DLC without a store page requires Valve help.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        Finally, you'll need to select the Steam Event announcing the release of this content.<br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Release all content until Season Pass is complete</strong> - Repeat these steps
        until your Season Pass is fully complete and you've shipped all of the content you promised
        customers who purchased your Season Pass. Congrats!
    </li>
</ol>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="7"></a>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<br />
<strong>Q. Should DLC content be exclusive to the Season Pass?</strong><br />
A. This is up to you. Content that’s included in your Season Pass can be exclusive to the Season
Pass, or it can also be made available outside of the Season Pass as individual purchases. The Store
supports either configuration. If you choose the latter, it’s a good idea to provide Season Pass
holders with a built-in discount or incentive for buying all the content upfront via the Season
Pass. <br />
<br />
<strong>Q. What’s the Difference Between a Season Pass and a Battle Pass?</strong><br />
A. A Battle Pass is similar but different to a Season Pass. In a Battle Pass set up, all content is
added to a specific DLC or Microtransaction at the start of a pre-defined gameplay season, and then
Battle Pass holders can earn and unlock any or all of the content in the DLC through normal gameplay
milestones, for example win 10, 20, 30 games... and so on. This may happen very quickly for highly
engaged players or more slowly for more casual players, but the pace of unlock is controlled by the
player's progress. For a Season Pass, you select when the content is released to customers, and that
release is not based on gameplay milestones. Somewhat muddying these two definitions is the fact
that many games creatively name their Battle Passes, sometimes even calling them Season Passes, but
for the purposes of this documentation, we’ll keep these functional definitions separate. <br />
<br />
<strong>Q. Will my Season Pass update automatically after I release DLC or content?</strong><br />
A. No.
<u
    >You will need to return to your Season Pass DLC and update it to indicate your content has been
    released.</u
>
Otherwise, your Season Pass won't be updated, and customers will think the promised content didn't
release into the Season Pass.<br />
<br />
<strong
    >Q. Can I provide advance access to DLCs to customers who have purchased a Season Pass?</strong
><br />
A. Yes, you can. You'd accomplish this by releasing the DLCs without a store page (and no other way
to purchase the DLCs that does not also provide Advanced Access). <br />
<br />
Then, once the DLC is released without a store page, you'd need to go into the Season Pass DLC
Season Pass Roadmap and indicate that the DLC has been released without a store page. Later, when
the DLC is available for purchase, you should update this in the Season Pass Roadmap.<br />
<br />
<u
    >Note: You will need Valve's assistance to release a DLC without a store page. Please reach out
    to us directly.</u
><br />
<br />
<strong>Q. Can I release DLC in a Season Pass ahead of schedule?</strong><br />
A. Of course! You can release DLC in a Season Pass any time before your indicated release date or
window. Please update your Season Pass Roadmap so that customers know the DLC has been released.<br />
<br />
