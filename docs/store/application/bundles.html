<h1>Bundles</h1>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="Overview"></a>Overview</h2>
Steam Bundles is a feature that allows multiple products to be bundled together at a discount to
provide additional value and benefit to your best fans.<br />

<br />
There are two types of Bundles to handle common scenarios:<br />
<br />
<ol class="bb_ol">
    <li>
        <strong>Complete The Set</strong> - Customers that purchase this type of Bundle will pay
        for, and receive, just the items in that bundle that they don't already have in their Steam
        library. This is most useful for bundles such as "Collector Pack" or "Franchise Pack" or
        "Developer Pack" that include two or more products (including games, software, or DLC). The
        customer can purchase one of these bundles as long as there is one or more item in the
        bundle they do not already have in their account. These types of Steam Bundles can only be
        purchased for the account making the transaction and cannot be sent or stored as gifts.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Purchase Together</strong> - this is useful for bundles such as "Soundtrack Edition"
        or "Deluxe Edition" that include just a base game and single piece of DLC or related
        application (such as a Soundtrack). The customer can purchase this bundle only if they do
        not already have any of the products in the bundle. These types of Steam Bundles may be
        purchased as gifts.
    </li>
</ol>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>How store bundles work</h2>
Steam Bundles work by applying a discount percentage (defined when creating the bundle) to all of
the packages in the bundle not already in the account of the purchasing customer.<br />
<br />
The three scenarios illustrated below show what the customer ends up paying based on the titles they
already have and what happens to the price when an item in the bundle is discounted.<br />
<br />

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="2"></a>Why Steam Bundles?</h2>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="3"></a>A better experience for your best fans</h2>
Past Collector Packs were a bad deal for customers that already own one or more of the products in
the pack. Either it made bad economic sense for those customers to purchase the pack, or they just
felt bad about doing so since it looks like they were paying for products they already have. The new
Steam Bundles system addresses this by allowing users to ‘complete the set’ and buy just the rest of
the bundle for a discount off the items in the bundle that they don’t own.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="4"></a>Consistent Discounting</h2>
Past Complete Packs often got out of sync with pricing when the contents of the packs went on sale,
resulting sometimes in the pack being more expensive than the individual items. The new Bundles
system addresses this by automatically adjusting when the contents go on sale so they are
proportionately always a good deal for customers and don’t require ongoing management on the part of
developers. We can do this because the bundle is just a specified percentage off the current price
of the items in the bundle.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="5"></a>Simplifying Regional Packages</h2>
This system also solves a number of region/low violence issues by eliminating the need to have
multiple Complete Packs configured. Instead, these Bundles will just show the user the items they
are able to purchase. So if a customer was in Germany, they would be purchasing a bundle and
automatically get the low violence version of a game where customers in other countries would be
purchasing the same bundle and automatically get the regular version of the game.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="6"></a>Creating a store bundle</h2>
When creating a new Steam Bundle there are a few key pieces, as well as some optional settings. You
must enter a name, a discount, the list of packages to include, and pick the type of bundle.<br />
<br />
Note that you need the "Manage pricing and discounts" permission for any game you wish to add to a
bundle.<br />
<br />
<ol class="bb_ol">
    <li>
        To create a Steam store bundle, select "Bundles" from the "App &amp; Packages" drop-down at
        the top of the Steamworks site.<br />
    </li>
    <li>From that page, you'll find a button for "Create New Bundle". Click that button.<br /></li>
    <li>
        You will be asked to name your bundle and enter a discount percentage.<br />
        <ul class="bb_ul">
            <li>
                <strong>Bundle Name</strong>: This is the name of the Steam Bundle and appears on
                the store page for products contained in the bundle.<br />
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Discount Percentage</strong>: This is the percentage to discount off the
                price of the individual items in the bundle being purchased by the customer. If it
                is a Complete The Set bundle, then the price may be different for different
                customers based on which and how many items in the bundle they already have in their
                account.<br />
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Bundle Type</strong>: You'll need to pick Complete The Set or Purchase
                Together. See definitions in the
                <a href="#Overview" class="bb_doclink">Overview section</a> above.<br />
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Next, you will need to select the packages of your game to include and add any store page
        details desired.<br />
        <ul class="bb_ul">
            <li>
                <strong>List of Packages</strong>: You'll need to pick the list of packages to
                include in the bundle. These should be the same store packages that are used to sell
                the products individually. This can include Games, Software, Movies, or DLC.<br />
                Please see the

            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Graphical Assets (optional but recommended)</strong>: You can upload a set
                of capsule images similar to what you created for your app store pages. These images
                are optional for Bundles, but your bundle can only appear in search results if
                images have been supplied. For details on the necessary graphical assets, please
                download our
                <a

                    >Bundles Asset Templates</a
                >. You will upload these by switching to the 'Graphical Assets' tab and uploading
                the desired capsule images.<br />
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Bundle Description (optional)</strong>: You can enter a written description
                for your bundle. The main "About this bundle" text will appear on the bundle page
                above the listing of contents. The "Sale Description" text is rarely used--it will
                appear if your bundle is included in a curated sale that has a specially-created
                landing page.<br />
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Preview Bundle In Store</strong>: You can preview your bundle page by clicking
        'Preview Bundle In Store' on the right-hand side. If you uploaded any graphical assets,
        you'll need to switch to the 'publish' tab and publish in order for your assets to appear on
        the bundle preview. The preview page may not show all your packages if some of those
        packages are not yet public on the store. Also, if none of the packages are currently
        visible, then we can't render a preview page for the bundle. You may want to preview and
        release your bundle after you release all the products in your bundle.<br />
        <br />

        /><br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Once you're happy with your bundle, you can release by completing the following two
        steps:<br />
        <ul class="bb_ul">
            <li>
                <strong>Publish Assets</strong>: Switch to the 'Publish' tab and click the publish
                options to make sure that any graphical assets and written description are published
                out to public servers.<br />
                <br />
                <img

                    title="AdminUI_publish.jpg"
                /><br />
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Enable Bundle</strong>: Click the green-colored 'Set Live' button to make
                your bundle live for customers. The bundle page itself should be visible
                immediately, but it will take a few minutes for the bundle to appear listed as a
                purchase option on each individual product page for the products in the bundle.<br />
                <br />

                />
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="bb_section"><a name="7"></a>Maintaining a Bundle</h2>
        Bundles can be modified to add or remove included items, adjust discount percentage, or edit
        assets and/or description.
        <h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="8"></a>Adding items</h2>
        If you add items to an existing Complete The Set bundle, then customers that have already
        purchased the bundle may do so again to purchase just the new items for the discount
        percentage. This can be a great way to encourage your best fans to get every item of your
        DLC or every title in your franchise.
        <h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="9"></a>Removing items</h2>
        You can also remove items from an existing bundle at any time as long as at least two items
        remain in the bundle. Removing a package from a bundle does not impact existing customers of
        a bundle and will only affect what packages will be purchased by customers from that point
        forward.
        <h2 class="bb_section"><a name="visibility"></a>Bundle Visibility</h2>
        Bundles will appear on product store pages just like other purchase options for the game.
        They can also be found by using the store search field. Each bundle has it's own detail
        page, which can optionally include branding images and a written description.
        <h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="visibilitylimits"></a>Limits to Bundle Visibility</h2>
        There are two forms of visibility limitations for bundles on Steam:<br />
        <ol class="bb_ol">
            <li>
                Game Page Visibility - A maximum of three bundles can appear on any given game store
                page. So if you have more than three bundles that contain a game, only the top three
                best-selling bundles that contain that game.<br />
            </li>
            <li>
                Country-Specific Visibility - A bundle may become unavailable in certain countries
                based on the average price of the items in that bundle.
                <ol class="bb_ol">
                    <li>
                        <strong>For complete-the-set bundles</strong>, the items must cost an
                        average of

                        in each currency ($0.49 USD adjusted for each currency). For any country
                        where the average price of the items in the bundle falls below this minimum,
                        the bundle will become unavailable. <br />

                A. You can create as many bundles as you wish that contain a product, but the
                product store page may only show a maximum of three bundles that contain that
                product. The store page will show the top selling bundles based on revenue.<br />

                A. You can add any game, software, or video that you have the "Manage pricing and
                discounts" permission for. To edit a bundle, you also need to have one of the
                following permissions on each app included in the bundle: Edit App Metadata, Edit
                App Marketing Data, Publish App Changes To Steam.<br />

                <strong>Q. Can Steam Bundles be refunded?</strong><br />
                A. Yes, the individual parts of that bundle may be refunded following the same
                refund rules for the type of content purchased (game, dlc, movie).<br />

                    a bundle?</strong
                ><br />
                A. A bundle has a set percentage that will be discounted off the calculated price of
                each contained item. The bundle itself cannot be discounted for a limited time, but
                will adjust in price based on the discounts applied to the contents of a bundle.<br />

            <li>
                <strong>Q. How often can I adjust the contents of a Bundle?</strong><br />
                A. You can add and remove items from your bundle when you need to. But you probably
                don't need to do this very often aside from adding new products that you've
                released.<br />

            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Q. Is there a limit to how deeply I can discount a Bundle?</strong><br />
                You can set a bundle to discount up to 75% off the contained items. However, if the
                average price of products in your bundle falls below the minimum, the bundle will
                not appear to customers and cannot be purchased. See
                <a href="http://#visibilitylimits" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"

                <strong>Q. Can Steam Bundles be purchased as a gift for a friend?</strong><br />
                A. Steam Bundles configured as "Complete The Set" can only be purchased for your own
                account. Steam Bundles configured as "Must Purchase Together" may be purchased as a
                gift for a friend.<br />

            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Q. Can I request keys for a Steam Bundle?</strong><br />
                A. Steam Bundles do not have the ability to have keys associated with them. If you
                need keys that grant users multiple products, you'll need to use a key-only package
                for those contents. Please contact Valve if you need that package created.<br />
                <br />
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Q. Where can I track unit and revenue sales for my bundles?</strong><br />
                A. The revenue and units for sales of a bundle are currently just included in the
                sales indicated for each individual product sold (by package). So if Game A and Game
                B were sold together in a bundle, the sale would appear as 1 unit of Game A and 1
                unit of Game B. The CSV from the Sales &amp; Activations Reports portal will also
                indicate if a package sale was recorded as being sold in a bundle.
