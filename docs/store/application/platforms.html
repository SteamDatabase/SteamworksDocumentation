This section describes the general workflow and settings necessary for releasing your application on
additional operating systems.<br /><br />Steam provides support for Windows, macOS, and Linux

<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="3"></a>Apple macOS</h2>
Steam officially supports Intel Mac, OS X version 10.11 (El Capitan), or later.<br /><br /><strong
    >Notarization</strong
><br />Starting October 14th, 2019 Steam will require all new macOS Applications to be 64-bit and
notarized by Apple. If your Mac application already supports 64-bit, please login to Steamworks and
select the "macOS -&gt; 64 Bit Binaries Included" checkbox in the "Supported Operating Systems"
section for your application. This will ensure that your macOS app will appear as compatible for
users who are running Steam on macOS 10.15. <br /><br /><img

/><br /><br />You can read more about Apple's plan to drop support of 32-bit Mac applications in the
support article
<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208436" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">HERE</a
>.<br /><br />If you're not familiar with Apple's 64-bit requirements or the notarization process in
macOS you can read more about that

    target="_blank"
    rel="noreferrer"
    >HERE</a
>.<br /><br />If you have already had your 64-bit Mac Application Notarized by Apple, please check
the App Bundles Are Notarized checkbox in Steamworks as well.<br /><br /><strong
    >Entitlements</strong
><br />Support for 10.15 (Catalina) requires adding the following entitlements to your build
configuration<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight"
            >com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation
        </code>
        (allows loading the Steamworks SDK library and overlay library)<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight"
            >com.apple.security.cs.allow-dyld-environment-variables
        </code>
        (enables the overlay library to be injected into the game process)
    </li>
</ul>
<br />You can find additional information about these entitlements and other app security details

>.<br /><br /><strong>32-bit Mac apps</strong><br />Steam users who have purchased older 32-bit Mac
apps still have a license to those apps on Steam and will still have access to those apps in their
Steam Library. MacOS 32-bit applications will continue to work on macOS 10.14 Mojave and older macOS
versions. In addition, Steam users are protected by Steam Play and will be able to play those games
on other supported platforms as well at no additional charge. You can read more about ways users can
continue playing their Steam library on Mac computers

<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="4"></a>Linux &amp; SteamOS</h2>
Steam only officially supports
<a href="http://ubuntu.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Ubuntu</a> running Ubuntu 12.04 LTS or
newer and SteamOS, but the
<a href="http://steamcommunity.com/app/221410" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Steam for Linux</a>
community is extremely resourceful and has managed to run Steam on a large variety of distros. Valve
approves of these efforts but does not officially endorse or provide support for them. Steam on
Linux supports both x86 and x64, it's highly recommended that you ship 64 bit binaries as the vast
majority of users will be running that.<br /><br />The

For general help with building depots and preparing content, please see
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/sdk/uploading" class="bb_doclink">Uploading to Steam</a
><br />
<ol class="bb_ol">
    <li>
        In the Steamworks Settings for your application, create
        <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/application/depots" class="bb_doclink"
            >depots</a
        >
        for the new operating systems in the Creating &amp; Adding Depots section (under the
        "SteamPipe" tab&gt;Depots).<br />
        Save this change.<br />
        <strong>NOTE:</strong> Don't check the boxes under
        <strong>Supported Operating Systems</strong> on the General Application Settings tab yet,
        that will be done when you're ready to release.<br />
    </li>
    <li>Create a Steam build for these new depots.<br /></li>
    <li>Set that build to a beta branch with a password.<br /></li>
    <li>
        Update your autogrant package to contain these new depots so Steam will let you download the
        files. You can find your autogrant package by on the
        <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/apps/associated/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"

    </li>
    <li>Test the new versions on whatever operating system you are targeting.</li>
</ol>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="7"></a>Releasing</h2>
When you are ready to release, you will need to make sure that you add the necessary depots to any
public packages and update your store page to reflect the new content available.<br />
<ol class="bb_ol">

    <li>
        Finally, return to your Steamworks Settings page and move the build to the Default branch.
        (Under the SteamPipe tab &gt; Depots)<br />
