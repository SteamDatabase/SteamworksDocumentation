<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Overview</h2>
This section describes the general workflow and settings necessary for releasing your application on
additional operating systems.<br />
<br />
Steam provides support for Windows, macOS, and Linux (SteamOS).<br />
<br />
You can see platform usage stats from the
<a href="http://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
    >Steam Hardware Survey</a

to help you make decisions on what platforms you are going to want to support.

<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="3"></a>Apple macOS</h2>
Steam officially supports Intel Mac, OS X version 10.11 (El Capitan), or later.<br />
<br />
<strong>Notarization</strong><br />
Starting October 14th, 2019 Steam will require all new macOS Applications to be 64-bit and notarized
by Apple. If your Mac application already supports 64-bit, please login to Steamworks and select the
"macOS -&gt; 64 Bit Binaries Included" checkbox in the "Supported Operating Systems" section for
your application. This will ensure that your macOS app will appear as compatible for users who are
running Steam on macOS 10.15. <br />
<br />

<br />
You can read more about Apple's plan to drop support of 32-bit Mac applications in the support
article
<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208436" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">HERE</a>.<br />
<br />
If you're not familiar with Apple's 64-bit requirements or the notarization process in macOS you can

<br />
If you have already had your 64-bit Mac Application Notarized by Apple, please check the App Bundles
Are Notarized checkbox in Steamworks as well.<br />
<br />
<strong>Entitlements</strong><br />
Support for 10.15 (Catalina) requires adding the following entitlements to your build
configuration<br />
<ul>
    <li>
        <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight"
            >com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation
        </code>
        (allows loading the Steamworks SDK library and overlay library)<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight"
            >com.apple.security.cs.allow-dyld-environment-variables
        </code>
        (enables the overlay library to be injected into the game process)
    </li>
</ul>

        entitlement. As this entitlement is required for distribution on the Mac App Store, please
        be sure it is not set in the build uploaded to Steam if building for both stores.

<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="4"></a>Linux &amp; SteamOS</h2>
Steam only officially supports
<a href="http://ubuntu.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Ubuntu</a> running Ubuntu 12.04 LTS or
newer and SteamOS, but the
<a href="http://steamcommunity.com/app/221410" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Steam for Linux</a>
community is extremely resourceful and has managed to run Steam on a large variety of distros. Valve
approves of these efforts but does not officially endorse or provide support for them. Steam on
Linux supports both x86 and x64, it's highly recommended that you ship 64 bit binaries as the vast
majority of users will be running that.<br />

    <a name="5"></a>Steamworks Video Tutorial - Adding New Platforms and Languages
</h2>
This tutorial walks you through adding new platforms and languages to your game by adding additional
<a href="/doc/store/application/depots">depots</a> to your app.<br />
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PShS32hcing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="6"></a>Building and Testing</h2>
For general help with building depots and preparing content, please see
<a href="/doc/sdk/uploading">Uploading to Steam</a><br />
<ol>
    <li>
        In the Steamworks Settings for your application, create
        <a href="/doc/store/application/depots">depots</a> for the new operating systems in the
        Creating &amp; Adding Depots section (under the "SteamPipe" tab&gt;Depots).<br />
        Save this change.<br />
        <strong>NOTE:</strong> Don't check the boxes under
        <strong>Supported Operating Systems</strong> on the General Application Settings tab yet,
        that will be done when you're ready to release.<br />
    </li>
    <li>Create a Steam build for these new depots.<br /></li>
    <li>Set that build to a beta branch with a password.<br /></li>
    <li>
        Update your autogrant package to contain these new depots so Steam will let you download the
        files. You can find your autogrant package by on the
        <a href="/apps/associated/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
            >Associated Packages &amp; DLC</a
        >
        page.<br />
    </li>
    <li>Test the new versions on whatever operating system you are targeting.</li>
</ol>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="7"></a>Releasing</h2>
When you are ready to release, you will need to make sure that you add the necessary depots to any
public packages and update your store page to reflect the new content available.<br />
<ol>
    <li>
        Add the new <a href="/doc/store/application/depots">depots</a> to all existing
        <a href="/doc/store/application/packages">packages</a> of the game (so users will get them).
        You can see all packages associated with your application on the
        <a href="/apps/associated/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
            >Associated Packages &amp; DLC</a
        >
        page.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        In the
        <a href="/apps/view/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Steamworks Settings for your app</a>,
        check the appropriate operating system boxes under
        <strong>Supported Operating Systems</strong>.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Edit your store page and check the appropriate operating system boxes on the Basic Info
        tab.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Then scroll down and enter the corresponding system requirements. Preview your store page
        and then publish your changes when you're happy with how the system requirements appear.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Finally, return to your Steamworks Settings page and move the build to the Default branch.
        (Under the SteamPipe tab &gt; Depots)<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Head over to the Steam Community Hub for your application and post an announcement to let
        existing and prospective customers know you've updated!
    </li>
</ol>
