<h1>Packages</h1>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Overview</h2>
A package is a collection of one or more applications and depots that can be
sold via Steam or can be granted to users based on the activation of a Steam
key. This can be thought of as an SKU or a license.<br /><br />After a user
purchases or activates a package, the contents of that package dictate which
applications or depot contents the user has permission to download and launch.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="2"></a>Types of packages</h2>
Any new application created in the Steamworks system will by default be included
in a new package with which that application can be sold via Steam and can have
keys generated against it.<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
  <li>
    <strong>Store + CD-Key Package (Default)</strong>: All new applications in
    the Steamworks system come with this type of package by default. This lets
    you sell your app in the Steam store as well as generate CD Keys that unlock
    the exact same content if you wish.<br />
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Store Package</strong>: This is a package that can only be sold on
    the Steam store<br />
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>CD Key Package</strong>: This is a package that can only have CD
    Keys generated against it<br />
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Release Override "Beta Testing" Package</strong>: This package is
    automatically created along with your Application. Content in Release
    Override packages is specially flagged to ignore the current release state
    of the Application and make it immediately playable. These packages are
    useful to give to testers, press, or other groups that need to play your
    game before it's officially released to the public.<br />
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Developer Comp Package</strong>: This package is similar to the
    "Beta Testing" packages, but is meant to be used by developer accounts. You
    should not publicly distribute keys to Developer Comp packages. This package
    is autogranted to accounts in the "Everyone" group in your Steamworks
    partner accounts, and like "Beta Testing" packages, make any content inside
    of it immediately playable regardless of the Release State. Developer Comp
    packages are also useful for testing with accounts which aren’t in your
    Steamworks partner group, and testing new Depot content on released
    products.
  </li>
</ul>

  <div>
    <strong>Note:</strong> It is not possible to create packages that grant
    multiple copies of an application (e.g. "4-packs"). While there are legacy
    examples of this on Steam, they are no longer being created.

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="editing_packages"></a>Editing packages</h2>
A package is accessible and editable by users that have permissions to edit
Steamworks Metadata for every app contained in that package. Users that have
been promoted to 'admin' status within a Steamworks partner account will also
have permissions to edit these packages.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="3"></a>How to edit</h2>
<ol class="bb_ol">
  <li>
    Select an application from your
    <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
      >Steamworks home page</a
    >, or from your list of
    <a
      href="https://partner.steamgames.com/apps/"
      target="_blank"
      rel="noreferrer"
      >all applications</a
    >
    to go to the landing page for that application<br />
  </li>
  <li>
    Once on an application landing page, click the item that says "All
    Associated Packages, DLC, Demos And Tools"<br />
  </li>
  <li>
    That takes you to a page where you can see all packages that contain your
    application.<br />
  </li>
  <li>
    You can then click on each package (in the "Store packages" section and in
    the "Promotional or special-use packages") to go to the landing page for
    each package.<br />
  </li>
  <li>
    On that landing page, you’ll see a section that says "Apps Included"<br />
    You can hit "Add Application" and then pick one or more applications to
    add<br />
  </li>
  <li>
    Another dialogue will come up immediately afterward, asking you to confirm
    adding the associated depots as well<br />
  </li>
  <li>
    From this landing page, you can also change the name of a package at any
    time
  </li>
</ol>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="4"></a>Editing unreleased packages</h2>
For packages that have not yet been released, users with the above permissions
will be able to add or remove applications and depots in that package. Doing
this, will effect which products are granted to users when they do eventually
purchase or activate keys that unlock that package, so be thoughtful in your
actions. You will not be able to remove the last application in a package, as
the permission to access a package is gated on the contents of the package.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="5"></a>Editing released packages</h2>
For packages that have already been released (either listed for sale, or have
had keys generated against them), you will not be able to remove applications.
However, users with the permissions described above can freely add or remove
depots at any time or add applications, which should allow you to ship
additional languages, platforms, or mod tools for your application any time you
wish. Be aware that any depots added to an active package will be granted
immediately to any users that own that package. Similarly, removing depots may
break applications if that content is required in order to run the products in
the package.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="6"></a>Gifting of packages</h2>
Steam allows you to sell products in a variety of currencies and price points
across the globe. Our suggested prices vary slightly from region to region, with
the goals of providing fair prices for customers. We therefore limit gifting
from lower-priced regions (e.g. South-East Asia) to higher-priced regions (e.g.
North America).
