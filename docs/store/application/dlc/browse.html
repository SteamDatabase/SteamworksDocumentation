<h1>DLC Visibility</h1>
If you have a game with DLC available for purchase (or for free) on Steam, it will automatically
appear in a number of places around Steam. You as the developer also have some options for how to
present your DLC to players.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>DLC Visibility Locations</h2>
These are the primary visibility locations for DLC on Steam:<br />
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Store, General</strong> - DLC can be recommended to players throughout the Steam
        store, or can be discovered by browsing and searching.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Your Game's Store Page</strong> - Your base game's store page lists the available
        DLC in an order that you can specify<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Your Game's DLC Browse Page </strong>- Each game automatically has a page that
        displays all of the available DLC, whether that is a single item or hundreds of items.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Store DLC Hub</strong> - A dedicated DLC Hub is currently an experiment in Steam
        Labs, where players can explore DLC for the games they play.
        <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/dlcforyou" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
            >Check out the DLC Hub</a
        >
        for more details. <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Your Game's Library Page </strong>- Your game's library page in Steam will
        prominently feature DLC that is new since the last time the player played the game. And DLC
        can always be found through the dedicated section on the right-hand side.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="2"></a>Steam Store, Generally</h2>
Like games themselves, DLC can be recommended to players of the game, discovered through various
browse and search pages, and even appear on top sellers lists. DLC can also appear in the discovery
queue.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="3"></a>On Your Game's Store Page</h2>
On your game's store page, there is a specific place just below the purchase option which will
display up to 5 DLC items with a button to expand and see all DLC. There will always be a 'Browse
All' button in this area, which leads to a dedicated browsing page for your game's DLC.<br />

    title="doc_store_dlc_gamePageList.jpg"
/><br />
<br />
You can control which items and in which order they appear on your store page, by modifying the list
of DLC in your edit store admin on the "Special Settings" tab.<br />
You can also highlight one item of DLC at the top of the DLC list in a bigger way. You might best
use this option to highlight your latest DLC release, or pin the most common content that players
are likely looking for. You can even highlight your next item of DLC that is coming if you’d like to
draw more attention to it for players to wishlist.<br />

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="4"></a>Your Game's DLC Browse Page</h2>
Any game that has DLC will automatically get a dedicated page for browsing that DLC. This offers
lists for Top Selling, New Releases, Upcoming, and discounted and provides for ways to customize
additional ways of organizing the DLC.<br />
<br />

    alt="browse_page_example_1.png"
    title="browse_page_example_1.png"
/>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="5"></a>Default Appearance</h2>
This browse page will automatically list your DLC with a couple of default logic. Here is a general
idea of what happens by default:<br />
<ul>
    <li>
        The page will first list out the items that you specified to appear on your base game's
        store page.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        If those items of DLC all have at least 4 screenshots, then we’ll display all those items of
        DLC in big sections on the browse page, which shows the short description, price, and 4
        screenshots.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        If not all the items have at least 4 screenshots, then we fall back to just showing a row of
        capsules.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="6"></a>Customization</h2>
You can customize these pages with a similar set of options that you have for configuring your
<a href="/doc/store/creator_homepage">developer or publisher homepages</a>.<br />
<ul>
    <li>
        You can create lists of <i>n</i> number of DLC if you want to define logical sets of DLC
        that should be grouped together to help players shop for that kind of content.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        You can upload custom header image to give your page stronger branding or to draw greater
        attention to your latest DLC.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        You can select sets of DLC to feature, including automatically populated sets such as Top
        Sellers, New Releases, Discounted, and Upcoming. Or you can feature an individual item or a
        list that you created.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        You can also edit the set of tags in the tabbed area to hide irrelevant tags and apply tags
        that make sense for sorting your collection of DLC.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Social media links that you set for your base game will appear at the top of your DLC browse
        page. To set these links, visit the 'basic info' tab in your edit store section of Steam.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="7"></a>Your Game's Library Page</h2>
Your game's library page in Steam will prominently feature DLC that is new since the last time the
player played the game. And DLC can always be found through the dedicated section on the right-hand
side.<br />

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="8"></a>FAQ</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        <h4>What does the follow button do?</h4>
        Clicking 'follow' at the top of the DLC browse page is the same as clicking 'follow' on your
        game page. Announcements that you as a developer post for this game will then appear in the
        activity feed of players that follow your game.
    </li>
</ul>
