<h1>Developing for SteamOS and Linux</h1>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Linux Overview</h2>
Steam for Linux is now available to all Steam users. With a growing catalog of Linux-supported games
and an active Steam for Linux community group, it's a good time to port your game to Linux.<br />
<br />
Developing a Linux game for Steam can be challenging for developers coming from a Windows or macOS
development background. The following information will help you successfully port your game to Steam
for Linux.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="2"></a>Getting Started</h2>
Building your game on Linux requires the following:<br />
<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        A development machine running a fully-updated version of Linux. This can be a dual-boot
        machine, a dedicated Linux machine, or even a virtual machine running Linux. In addition,
        development is supported on both 32- and 64-bit Linux distributions. The recommended Linux
        distribution is the latest Ubuntu LTS release as they received the most testing by Valve and
        the linux community.

            >Ubuntu can be installed from here</a
        >.<br />

            >The Steam for Linux client</a
        >.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        The basic Linux development tool set (e.g. g++, gcc, and a make utility); contained in the
        build-essential package. Install this package either by using Ubuntu Software Center or from
        an open terminal window with the apt-get command: sudo apt-get install build-essential.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        The latest version of the
        <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-runtime" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
            >Steam Linux Runtime</a
        >
        which includes the tools and a complete set of libraries required to ship Linux games on
        Steam. Instructions on how to use the runtime are included in the README.md contained within
        the repository.
    </li>
</ul>
<br />
If you have general Linux Steamworks questions or to report issues with the runtime, please join the
Steamworks Development Group and post on the Linux Discussions .
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="3"></a>Linux Tools</h2>
There is a vast array of Linux development tools ranging from command-line interfaces to graphical
developer IDEs. The following information is based on the experience of the Valve Linux team.<br />
<br />
For those with Windows development tool experience, the easiest route to Linux development is Visual
Studio on Windows and

debugging interface.<br />
<br />
For development on Linux, the following tools were used by the Valve Linux team:<br />

<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="4"></a>Linux APIs</h2>
<a href="https://www.khronos.org/vulkan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Vulkan</a> is the
prefered library for high-performance graphics rendering. It is the open equivalent to DirectX12 and
Metal.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.opengl.org/documentation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">OpenGL</a> was the
older standard graphics rendering. A majority of games make direct calls to OpenGL but there are
other games that use a translation method where legacy rendering code is translated into OpenGL
calls. This is the approach used by older Valve Source games such as Team Fortress 2 and
Counter-Strike: Source. If you choose OpenGL then we recommend using the core functionality in
OpenGL 3.0 for your game.<br />
<br />
Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL) version 2.0 provides low-level access to audio and windowing, amongst
many other things. Support for 3D rendering is provided using OpenGL. Installation instructions can
be found <a href="https://wiki.libsdl.org/Installation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a>.
For more information and documentation, see the SDL
<a href="https://wiki.libsdl.org/FrontPage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">wiki</a>. Valve uses
this in Steam and most of our games to handle windowing and it provides the backend which powers the

<br />
The following libraries provide support for other aspects of game development:<br />

    <li>

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="5"></a>Linux Runtime</h2>
Titles with native Linux support may select a specific version of the Steam for Linux runtime to
execute under. This can be set per branch. Note that the runtime you select needs to match the Steam
for Linux SDK used to compile your executables. For more details see
<a

><br />
<br />
To use this feature, your app must first setup a Launch Option that support Linux. Once that is
setup, you can go to Installation &gt; Linux Runtime menu item.

        <strong
            >Q: My Linux game has multiple external library dependencies. How do I solve this
            problem?</strong
        ><br />
        <strong>A:</strong> Many popular libraries such as SDL, OpenAL, FreeType and Fontconfig are
        all included in the
        <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-runtime" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
            >Steam Linux Runtime</a

        for your convenience. If you have other external library dependencies which are not in the
        runtime and are freely redistributable, please bring it up on the

        <strong>Q: Is there Steam DRM for Linux?</strong><br />
        <strong>A:</strong> Yes! The new
        <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">drmtoolp</code> DRM tool includes linux
        support. See
        <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/features/drm" class="bb_doclink">Steam DRM</a>
        for more information.<br />
        <br />
        <strong>Q: How does driver performance compare between Ubuntu and Windows?</strong><br />
        <strong>A:</strong> Proprietary Nvidia drivers are comparable to Windows in terms of
        stability, performance, and features. Proprietary drivers for both AMD and Intel are also
        available but their current performance and stability are lower than equivalent Windows
        drivers.<br />
        <br />
        In terms of Linux performance, it differs depending on the video card and driver type being
        used, e.g. such as open-source vs. proprietary. Typically, proprietary drivers out-perform
        open-source drivers and have a larger feature set. In addition, the age of the driver can
        vary between proprietary and open-source versions.<br />

            >Q: The
            <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/features/overlay" class="bb_doclink"

            >
            won't work when launching from outside of Steam.</strong
        ><br />
        <strong>A:</strong> On Linux you must set the LD_PRELOAD environment variable to load the
        gameoverlayrenderer.so<br />
        <br />
        This will look something like:<br />
        <div class="bb_code">
            export
            LD_PRELOAD=~/.local/share/Steam/ubuntu12_32/gameoverlayrenderer.so;~/.local/share/Steam/ubuntu12_64/gameoverlayrenderer.so
        </div>
        <br />
        <strong>Q: What runtime should I use for testing my Linux build?</strong><br />
        <strong>A:</strong> The recommended Linux distribution is the latest Ubuntu LTS release as
        it receives the most testing by Valve and the Linux community.
        <a href="https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
