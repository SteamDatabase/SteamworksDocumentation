<h1>Soundtrack för spel på Steam</h1>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Översikt</h2>
Steam stödjer försäljning och nedladdning av soundtrack för spel. Det krävs minimalt med arbete att
skapa och lägga upp ett soundtrack så vi vill uppmuntra dig att skapa en soundtrack-app även om du
tror att bara ett fåtal kunder skulle vara intresserade av musikinnehållet i ditt spel. Soundtrack
säljer särskilt bra som en del av ett paket tillsammans med spelet för ett lite högre pris.<br />
<br />
Det finns två specifika typer av innehåll för soundtrack:<br />
<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        <strong>Soundtracks associated with a Steam game</strong>: if your game is also sold on
        Steam, you can treat your soundtrack as a piece of additional content for that game, similar
        to DLC. You can create a new soundtrack associated with your game from the
        <i>Associated Packages, DLC, Demos, And Tools</i> link on the landing page for your app.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Soundtrack som inte associeras med ett Steam-spel</strong>: Om du har
        soundtrackinnehåll för spel som inte finns på Steam (inklusive äldre produkter och spel som
        inte säljs på Steam), så kan du skapa oberoende soundtrack. Dessa är inte associerade till
        ett specifikt spel, men kan fortfarande associeras med <br />
        <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/franchise_pages" class="bb_doclink"
            >franchiser</a
        >. You can create an independent soundtrack from your main partner landing page, the same
        way you would create a new game.
    </li>
</ul>
<br />
Båda sorters soundtrack är i grunden lika – de består av en samling mp3-filer och metadata som, om
man vill, kan innehålla andra komponenter, inklusive högkvalitativa/förlustfria ljudfiler,
tillhörande illustrationer, osv. Soundtracks that have a parent game are tightly associated with
that game -- the store pages will cross-link, they'll share a single Community Hub, etc.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="2"></a>Grundläggande konfiguration</h2>
<br />
När du har skapat en ny soundtrack-app genom partnersidan ser du en checklista för lansering som
beskriver vad som behöver göras för att appen ska ges ut. Soundtracket måste minst innehålla:<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>En omslagsbild till albumet.<br /></li>
    <li>
        En singel
        <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/application/depots" class="bb_doclink"
            >depå</a
        ><br />
        som innehåller ditt soundtrack i mp3-format. Du kan ladda upp depå-innehållet som en
        zip-fil. Läs vår guide här:

            >Simple Soundtrack Depots</a

    </li>

</ul>
<br />

partnersida.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="3"></a>Bästa tillvägagångssätt</h2>
<h4>Depots</h4>
We recommend creating a second depot and storing high-quality/lossless files (for example, FLAC or
WAV files) in this depot. Customers can choose whether they want to download the lossless files in
addition to the base MP3 files.
<h4>Additional Content</h4>
When there are other bits of highly-associated art content, for example liner notes or album back
cover images, you can upload them as pieces of additional artwork. Users can browse these pieces of
content from their library.
<h4>Metadata</h4>
We strongly recommend including basic metadata with each file (ie., ID3 tags inside MP3 files). When
available, this metadata will be used to determine the playback order of tracks. For multi-disc
soundtracks, track numbers must be unique across disks. For example, "disc 1, track 1" might have
track ID 1 and "disc 2, track 1" might have track ID 10.
<h4>Track Numbering</h4>
The Steam Music Player determines play order from the filenames, not the metadata. If your
soundtrack's play order is important, the track number should be included at the start of the
filename. If your soundtrack has 10 or more songs, the files 1-9 should begin with a leading 0 (e.g.
"01 - Song Title", "02 - Song Title", and so on).
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="4"></a>Preparing For Release</h2>
As you prepare for release, some of the process will depend on whether you are releasing a
stand-alone soundtrack vs. a soundtrack that is attached to a base game on Steam.<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        For soundtracks attached to a released base game on Steam, you may release the soundtrack as
        soon as the soundtrack's store and content have been reviewed and approved by our review
        team.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        For stand-alone soundtracks that don't depend on ownership of a base game on Steam, you'll
        need to have a 'coming soon' page visible on Steam for at least two weeks prior to
        releasing.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="5"></a>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<strong
    >Q: I uploaded contents to my soundtrack depot, but nothing downloads through Steam. Why aren't
    my files downloading?</strong
><br />
A: After you upload contents into your depot, you need to set a build live that references those new
contents. You can manage builds and set them live from the <strong>Builds</strong> page, under the
<strong>SteamPipe</strong> tab, on the partner site.<br />
<br />
<strong>Q: Is there a limit to the number of tracks or discs in a single soundtrack?</strong><br />
A: For all practical purposes, no. If you have extremely large amounts of content for a single game,
we recommend splitting that content into logically separate soundtrack apps (ie., "OST", "Piano
Collections", "Live", etc.).<br />
<br />
<strong>Q: Is my series anthology soundtrack associated with a single game?</strong><br />
A: No. For soundtracks that are relevant for multiple games from a series, or by a single composer,
or from a common developer/publisher, please create them as independent soundtracks. They can still
link to the relevant collections via franchises, publisher/developer tags, etc., but they aren't
associated with a particular single game.<br />
<br />
<strong>Q: Which audio formats are required? Which are optionally supported?</strong><br />
A: It's mandatory for each soundtrack to contain standard MP3s. Other formats, including raw WAVs,
FLAC, AAC, etc. can also optionally be included, but do not remove the requirement for MP3s to be
present. The Steam client will preferentially play lossless files when available and fall back to
lossy files if necessary. The Steam client currently supports playback of MP3, FLAC, M4A, and WAV
files.<br />
<br />
<strong>Q: What metadata does Steam look for in each audio file?</strong><br />
A: The Steam music player will attempt to find and use metadata for the track number, the track
name, the artist name, and the album name. These correspond to the "track", "title", "artist", and
"album" fields in ID3 tags.<br />
<br />
<strong>Q: What tools/reporting do I have about my soundtrack sales?</strong><br />
A: The same set of tools and reporting for games, DLC, and software apply to soundtracks.<br />
<br />
<strong
    >Q: I'm already selling my soundtrack content as DLC. Can I use the new soundtrack system? How
    do I convert?</strong
><br />
A: There is a helper tool on the partner site to transition content from the old format to the new
format. See

    class="bb_doclink"
    >Converting Existing DLC To Soundtracks</a
>
to see the details of the work involved.<br />
<br />
<strong
    >Q: Does the revenue for my associated game soundtrack count towards total revenue for the game
    for purposes of calculating revenue share?</strong
><br />
A: Yes.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="simpledepots"></a>Simple Soundtrack Depots</h2>
While soundtracks have access to the same advanced
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/application/depots" class="bb_doclink">depot</a>
configuration tools and settings, the average soundtrack is much simpler than the average game. This
section provides a simple guide for how to populate your soundtrack content without requiring any
scripts or commandline tools:<br />
<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        Create a ZIP file on your local machine containing the MP3s you want to be downloaded by
        users as part of your soundtrack.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        On your soundtrack's page on the partner site, click
        <strong>Edit Steamworks Settings</strong>, then click <strong>Depots</strong> under the
        <strong>SteamPipe</strong> tab.<br />
    </li>
    <li>Click the link that says <strong>Upload a zip file directly</strong>.<br /></li>
    <li>
        Select the ZIP file on your local machine and upload it. When it completes, depots for your
        soundtrack will build automatically. This may take a few seconds.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Once the depot is built, click the new button on that page to <strong>Commit</strong> the
        new depot contents.<br />
    </li>
    <li>Under the <strong>SteamPipe</strong> tab, click <strong>Builds</strong>.<br /></li>
    <li>
        Under the <strong>Set build live on branch</strong> heading, select
        <strong>default</strong> and click <strong>Preview Change</strong>.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        From the preview page, you can set the new depot content you just uploaded to be live for
        all customers.
    </li>
</ul>
<br />
Most of these steps are identical when creating high-quality audio depots. There are a small number
of additional steps that can take place after you have your regular MP3 depots set up:<br />
<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        Create a ZIP file on your local machine containing the high-quality audio files. We
        recommend these be in a subdirectory like "FLAC".<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        On the <strong>Depots</strong> page, create a new depot and set its type to
        <strong>Optional high-quality/uncompressed audio</strong>.<br />
    </li>
    <li>Save your depot configuration changes.<br /></li>
    <li>
        Publish the depot configuration changes. (Note: you won't be able to upload contents to the
        new depot until you've published this change.)<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Repeat the steps from above to upload your high-quality content to the new depot and set the
        new depot build live.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Once complete, from the landing page for your soundtrack, click the package under
        <strong>Store Packages</strong>.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Under <strong>Depots Included</strong>, add your new high-quality depot and save your
        changes.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="conversion"></a>Converting Existing DLC To Soundtracks</h2>
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/application/dlc" class="bb_doclink"
    >Downloadable Content (DLC)</a
>
support existed on Steam long before specific support for gaming soundtracks was added. Because of
this, many soundtracks are sold as DLC instead of soundtracks. When appropriate, we recommend
converting your DLC apps to Soundtrack apps. There are several benefits:<br />
<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        Users who don't own your game will be able to purchase your soundtracks. (DLC requires
        ownership of the base app for purchasing.)<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        User will be able to download your soundtrack content without downloading the content for
        the base game. (DLC requires downloading the base game content before downloading DLC.)<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Soundtrack content can be surfaced and marketed on the storefront in ways that DLC
        cannot.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        The music files will be placed into the Steam library music folder, rather than a
        subdirectory of your app's install directory.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        You have access to additional tools to provide album art, high-quality/lossless audio files,
        etc.
    </li>
</ul>
<br />
There is a tool to convert an existing DLC app to a soundtrack app that can be accessed through the
"Basic Info" tab in the Store Page Admin for your app. Once you click the button to start the
conversion process, you'll see a specific list of steps to follow to complete it.<br />
<br />
The conversion tool will make changes to the Steam configuration for your DLC, but will not publish
those changes. No changes will be visible to customers until you publish the changes after running
the tool. Customers that already own the DLC will automatically own the converted soundtrack.
<h2 class="bb_subsection">
    <a name="postconversion"></a>Ytterligare steg som krävs för att konvertera existerande DLC till
    soundtrack
</h2>
While the tool can do much of the work to convert your existing DLC content to a Soundtrack, there
are additional steps that you must complete before you are ready to publish your content:<br />
<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        <strong>Upload album cover artwork and metadata:</strong> in the Steamworks setting for your
        app, there will be a new "Soundtrack" tab. Please submit data appropriate to your content.
        The minimal set of data includes a single "album cover" image and the title and duration of
        each track.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Review and publish your Steamworks settings:</strong> Your Steamworks changes will
        include both automated changes made by the DLC-to-soundtrack conversion process, as well as
        the changes you made in the previous steps. Review all these changes and publish when ready
        from the Steamworks Publish page.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Review and publish Steamworks settings for the parent game:</strong> depending on
        the configuration of your DLC and its depots, the automated conversion may also have made
        changes to the Steamworks settings for the parent app. If any changes were made, please
        review them and publish them when ready.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Review and publish your store page:</strong> Your store page will look slightly
        different now. Please review and re-publish. Learn more about
        <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/editing" class="bb_doclink"
            >Editing A Store Page</a
        >.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Upload audio depots:</strong> you can configure your soundtrack depots from the
        Depot configuration page. Note that, in order to create and publish a release for your
        soundtrack, <strong>you'll have to upload your MP3s after converting the app</strong>, so
        please have those files handy. If you have high-quality (ie., FLAC) versions of your audio,
        you can upload them in a separate depot for users who opt-in. <i>Note</i>: depending on your
        previous DLC configuration, you may be unable to edit depots until completing the above
        steps. The conversion tool will not migrate your builds, so once you've uploaded your
        content you'll need to set a new build live.
    </li>
</ul>
<br />
Once you've completed these steps, your soundtrack is ready!<br />
