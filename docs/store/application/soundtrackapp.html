<h1>Game Soundtracks on Steam</h1>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Overview</h2>
Steam supports selling and downloading of game soundtracks. The work to create
and associate a soundtrack is minimal, so we encourage you to create a
soundtrack app if you think even a small number of customers would be interested
in the music content of your game. Soundtracks sell particularly well as a
component of a bundle including the base game and the soundtrack for a slight
price increase.<br /><br />There are two distinct types of soundtrack
content:<br /><br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
  <li>
    <strong>Soundtracks associated with a Steam game</strong>: if your game is
    also sold on Steam, you can treat your soundtrack as a piece of additional
    content for that game, similar to DLC. You can create a new soundtrack
    associated with your game from the
    <i>Associated Packages, DLC, Demos, And Tools</i> link on the landing page
    for your app.<br />
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Soundtracks not associated with a Steam game</strong>: if you have
    soundtrack content for non-Steam games (including older products and games
    that aren't for sale on Steam), you can create independent soundtracks.
    These aren't associated with a particular game, but can still be associated
    with
    <a
      href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/franchise_pages"
      class="bb_doclink"
      >franchises</a
    >. You can create an independent soundtrack from your main partner landing
    page, the same way you would create a new game.
  </li>
</ul>
<br />Both types of soundtracks are fundamentally similar: they are a collection
of MP3s and metadata that can optionally include other components, including
high-quality/lossless audio files, associated artwork, etc. Soundtracks that
have a parent game are tightly associated with that game -- the store pages will
cross-link, they'll share a single Community Hub, etc.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="2"></a>Basic Configuration</h2>
<br />Once you've created a new soundtrack app through the partner site, you'll
see a release checklist that describes the steps necessary to ship. The minimum
required soundtrack content is:<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
  <li>A single album cover image.<br /></li>
  <li>
    A single
    <a
      href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/application/depots"
      class="bb_doclink"
      >depot</a
    >
    containing your soundtrack audio as MP3s. You can upload your depot contents
    as a simple ZIP file. See
    <a
      href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/application/soundtrackapp#simpledepots"
      class="bb_doclink"
      >Simple Soundtrack Depots</a
    >
    for a guide.<br />
  </li>
  <li>Basic metadata describing the content of your album (artist, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<br />Tools to query and update these types of content are available on the
Steamworks partner site.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="3"></a>Best Practices</h2>
We recommend creating a second depot and storing high-quality/lossless files
(for example, FLAC or WAV files) in this depot. Customers can choose whether
they want to download the lossless files in addition to the base MP3 files.<br /><br />When
there are other bits of highly-associated art content, for example liner notes
or album back cover images, you can upload them as pieces of additional artwork.
Users can browse these pieces of content from their library.<br /><br />We
strongly recommend including basic metadata with each file (ie., ID3 tags inside
MP3 files). When available, this metadata will be used to determine the playback
order of tracks. For multi-disc soundtracks, track numbers must be unique across
disks. For example, "disc 1, track 1" might have track ID 1 and "disc 2, track
1" might have track ID 10.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="4"></a>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<strong
  >Q: I uploaded contents to my soundtrack depot, but nothing downloads through
  Steam. Why aren't my files downloading?</strong
><br />A: After you upload contents into your depot, you need to set a build
live that references those new contents. You can manage builds and set them live
from the <strong>Builds</strong> page, under the <strong>SteamPipe</strong> tab,
on the partner site.<br /><br /><strong
  >Q: Is there a limit to the number of tracks or discs in a single
  soundtrack?</strong
><br />A: For all practical purposes, no. If you have extremely large amounts of
content for a single game, we recommend splitting that content into logically
separate soundtrack apps (ie., "OST", "Piano Collections", "Live", etc.).<br /><br /><strong
  >Q: Is my series anthology soundtrack associated with a single game?</strong
><br />A: No. For soundtracks that are relevant for multiple games from a
series, or by a single composer, or from a common developer/publisher, please
create them as independent soundtracks. They can still link to the relevant
collections via franchises, publisher/developer tags, etc., but they aren't
associated with a particular single game.<br /><br /><strong
  >Q: Which audio formats are required? Which are optionally supported?</strong
><br />A: It's mandatory for each soundtrack to contain standard MP3s. Other
formats, including raw WAVs, FLAC, AAC, etc. can also optionally be included,
but do not remove the requirement for MP3s to be present. The Steam client will
preferentially play lossless files when available and fall back to lossy files
if necessary. The Steam client currently supports playback of MP3, FLAC, M4A,
and WAV files.<br /><br /><strong
  >Q: What metadata does Steam look for in each audio file?</strong
><br />A: The Steam music player will attempt to find and use metadata for the
track number, the track name, the artist name, and the album name. These
correspond to the "track", "title", "artist", and "album" fields in ID3 tags.<br /><br /><strong
  >Q: What tools/reporting do I have about my soundtrack sales?</strong
><br />A: The same set of tools and reporting for games, DLC, and software apply
to soundtracks.<br /><br /><strong
  >Q: I'm already selling my soundtrack content as DLC. Can I use the new
  soundtrack system? How do I convert?</strong
><br />A: There is a helper tool on the partner site to transition content from
the old format to the new format. See
<a
  href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/application/soundtrackapp#conversion"
  class="bb_doclink"
  >Converting Existing DLC To Soundtracks</a
>
to see the details of the work involved.<br /><br /><strong
  >Q: Does the revenue for my associated game soundtrack count towards total
  revenue for the game for purposes of calculating revenue share?</strong
><br />A: Yes.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="simpledepots"></a>Simple Soundtrack Depots</h2>
While soundtracks have access to the same advanced
<a
  href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/application/depots"
  class="bb_doclink"
  >depot</a
>
configuration tools and settings, the average soundtrack is much simpler than
the average game. This section provides a simple guide for how to populate your
soundtrack content without requiring any scripts or commandline tools:<br /><br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
  <li>
    Create a ZIP file on your local machine containing the MP3s you want to be
    downloaded by users as part of your soundtrack.<br />
  </li>
  <li>
    On your soundtrack's page on the partner site, click
    <strong>Edit Steamworks Settings</strong>, then click the
    <strong>Depots</strong> tab under <strong>SteamPipe</strong>.<br />
  </li>
  <li>
    Click the link that says <strong>Upload a zip file directly</strong>.<br />
  </li>
  <li>
    Select the ZIP file on your local machine and upload it. When it completes,
    depots for your soundtrack will build automatically. This may take a few
    seconds.<br />
  </li>
  <li>
    Once the depot is built, click the new button on that page to
    <strong>Commit</strong> the new depot contents.<br />
  </li>
  <li>
    Under the <strong>SteamPipe</strong> tab, click
    <strong>Builds</strong>.<br />
  </li>
  <li>
    Under the <strong>Set build live on branch</strong> heading, select
    <strong>default</strong> and click <strong>Preview Change</strong>.<br />
  </li>
  <li>
    From the preview page, you can set the new depot content you just uploaded
    to be live for all customers.
  </li>
</ul>
<br />Most of these steps are identical when creating high-quality audio depots.
There are a small number of additional steps that can take place after you have
your regular MP3 depots set up:<br /><br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
  <li>
    Create a ZIP file on your local machine containing the high-quality audio
    files. We recommend these be in a subdirectory like "FLAC".<br />
  </li>
  <li>
    On the <strong>Depots</strong> page, create a new depot and set its type to
    <strong>Optional high-quality/uncompressed audio</strong>.<br />
  </li>
  <li>Save your depot configuration changes.<br /></li>
  <li>
    Publish the depot configuration changes. (Note: you won't be able to upload
    contents to the new depot until you've published this change.)<br />
  </li>
  <li>
    Repeat the steps from above to upload your high-quality content to the new
    depot and set the new depot build live.<br />
  </li>
  <li>
    Once complete, from the landing page for your soundtrack, click the package
    under <strong>Store Packages</strong>.<br />
  </li>
  <li>
    Under <strong>Depots Included</strong>, add your new high-quality depot and
    save your changes.
  </li>
</ul>

</h2>
<a

  class="bb_doclink"
  >Downloadable Content (DLC)</a

support existed on Steam long before specific support for gaming soundtracks was
added. Because of this, many soundtracks are sold as DLC instead of soundtracks.
When appropriate, we recommend converting your DLC apps to Soundtrack apps.
There are several benefits:<br /><br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
  <li>
    Users who don't own your game will be able to purchase your soundtracks.
    (DLC requires ownership of the base app for purchasing.)<br />
  </li>
  <li>
    User will be able to download your soundtrack content without downloading
    the content for the base game. (DLC requires downloading the base game
    content before downloading DLC.)<br />
  </li>
  <li>
    Soundtrack content can be surfaced and marketed on the storefront in ways
    that DLC cannot.<br />
  </li>
  <li>
    The music files will be placed into the Steam library music folder, rather
    than a subdirectory of your app's install directory.<br />
  </li>
  <li>
    You have access to additional tools to provide album art,
    high-quality/lossless audio files, etc.
  </li>
</ul>
<br />There is a tool to convert an existing DLC app to a soundtrack app that
can be accessed through the "Basic Info" tab in the Store Page Admin for your
app. Once you click the button to start the conversion process, you'll see
specific a list of steps to follow to complete it.<br /><br />The conversion
tool will make changes to the Steam configuration for your DLC, but will not
publish those changes. No changes will be visible to customers until you publish
the changes after running the tool. Customers that already own the DLC will
automatically own the converted soundtrack.
<h2 class="bb_subsection">
  <a name="postconversion"></a>Additional Steps Required to Convert Existing DLC
  to Soundtracks
</h2>
While the tool can do much of the work to convert your existing DLC content to a
Soundtrack, there are additional steps that you must complete before you are
ready to publish your content:<br /><br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
  <li>
    <strong>Upload album cover artwork and metadata:</strong> in the Steamworks
    setting for your app, there will be a new "Soundtrack" tab. Please submit
    data appropriate to your content. The minimal set of data includes a single
    "album cover" image and the title and duration of each track.<br />
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Review and publish your Steamworks settings:</strong> Your
    Steamworks changes will include both automated changes made by the
    DLC-to-soundtrack conversion process, as well as the changes you made in the
    previous steps. Review all these changes and publish when ready from the
    Steamworks Publish page.<br />
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Review and publish Steamworks settings for the parent game:</strong>
    depending on the configuration of your DLC and its depots, the automated
    conversion may also have made changes to the Steamworks settings for the
    parent app. If any changes were made, please review them and publish them
    when ready.<br />
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Review and publish your store page:</strong> Your store page will
    look slightly different now. Please review and re-publish. Learn more about

      class="bb_doclink"
      >Editing A Store Page</a
    >.<br />
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Upload audio depots:</strong> you can configure your soundtrack
    depots from the Depot configuration page. Note that, in order to create and
    publish a release for your soundtrack,
    <strong>you'll have to upload your MP3s after converting the app</strong>,
    so please have those files handy. If you have high-quality (ie., FLAC)
    versions of your audio, you can upload them in a separate depot for users
    who opt-in. <i>Note</i>: depending on your previous DLC configuration, you
    may be unable to edit depots until completing the above steps. The
    conversion tool will not migrate your builds, so once you've uploaded your
    content you'll need to set a new build live.
  </li>
</ul>
<br />Once you've completed these steps, your soundtrack is ready!
