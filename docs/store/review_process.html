<h1>Review Process</h1>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Overview</h2>
Once you have completed your checklists, your store presence and product build will need to be
reviewed by Valve before you can release your game or software. You'll need to click "Mark as ready
for review" to communicate to Valve that you have completed the necessary work items and are ready
for your store page and proposed pricing to be reviewed. <br /><br />Please see our
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/types" class="bb_doclink">Release Options</a>
documentation for more information how to release your product on Steam.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="2"></a>Reviewing Store Presence</h2>
Our review of your store presence typically takes 3-5 business days to complete. We'll send you any
feedback if necessary, or if none is necessary, we'll mark your store page as "Ready for
release".<br /><br />Here's a list of things we check for when reviewing the store presence for your
product:<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        <strong
            >Your store page should only contain features and content that will be available at
            launch</strong
        ><br />You will need to remove screenshots, trailers, or features listed that contain
        content that are incomplete or planned to be implemented. If you include content that's
        planned to be implemented later in your description section, it will need to be clear that
        the feature is currently not released. <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Your capsule images will need to include a readable product title or logo.</strong
        ><br />You can learn more about our guidelines in the
        <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/assets" class="bb_doclink"
            >Graphical Assets - Overview</a
        >
        documentation.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Your screenshots must only contain gameplay.</strong> This means avoid using concept
        art, pre-rendered cinematic stills, or images that contain awards, marketing copy, or
        written product descriptions.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>The description will need to be detailed and coherent.</strong><br />It's important
        that customers know what to expect before they purchase your product. You should not include
        links to other websites from this section.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="3"></a>Reviewing Early Access Store Page</h2>
For titles that are releasing in Early Access, you will need to answer all the questions in the
Early Access section. In this section, you want to give customers a clear expectation of what the
current version of your game contains, and what features and content still need to be added before
the game is considered complete. You can view the
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/earlyaccess" class="bb_doclink">Early Access</a>
documentation for more information.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="4"></a>Reviewing Adult Content Store Page</h2>
For titles that have marked the "Adult Only Sexual Content" section in the Mature Content Survey,
both the Store Page and Product Build must be completed and submitted for review before the Store
Page will be reviewed and set to "Ready for release". Adult Content store pages and builds can take
longer than the typical 3-5 business days to review.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="5"></a>Reviewing Product Build</h2>
Our review of your game or software build prior to release typically takes 3-5 business days to
complete, but we ask that you plan for at least five business days to ensure that we are able to
review and approve in time for release and to allow for time in case an issue should arise. We'll
send you any feedback if necessary, or if none is necessary, we'll mark your product as "Ready for
release".<br /><br />Here's a list of things we check for when reviewing your product:<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        <strong>Your product will need to start up properly.</strong><br />This means that your
        product must successfully launch in all supported operating systems listed on the store
        page. <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong
            >All supported features listed on the store page will need to be implemented in the
            current build.</strong
        ><br />If you intend to add a feature in the future, you'll need to remove the selected
        feature in the Basic Info tab until it is implemented and released.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Your product must use Steam Wallet for any in-game transactions.</strong><br />This
        means that your product cannot link to other store pages that does not offer Steam Wallet.
    </li>
</ul>
<br />You can continue to make updates and changes to your build after review and approval, but you
should be submitting a near-final build for review.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="6"></a>Reviewing Trading Cards</h2>
Our review of your trading cards typically takes 2-3 business days. Any necessary feedback will be
provided to you via the tool. Once all your trading card assets are uploaded, click the edit link
beneath “Release State” to configure your card drop settings and mark your assets as ready for
review. Once set as ready for review, your cards will automatically appear in our queue to review by
a Valve designer. <br /><br />After your assets are approved, you'll see the status update on your
Steamworks home page. You’ll then be able to set the release state to “Released” and publish the
items. You can check our
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/marketing/tradingcards" class="bb_doclink"

documentation for more information.<br /><br />
