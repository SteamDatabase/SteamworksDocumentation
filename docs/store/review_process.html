<h1>Review Process</h1>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Overview</h2>
Your game's store presence and build will need to be reviewed by Valve's review team before you can
release on Steam. You'll need to click "Mark as ready for review" to communicate to Valve that you
have completed the necessary release checklist items and are ready for review.<br />
<br />
Please see our <a href="/doc/store/types">Release Options</a> documentation for more information how
to release your product on Steam.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="2"></a>Review once; Update any time</h2>
Once your game has been reviewed and approved, there is no need to go through review again. You are
free to update your game as much as you need to.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="3"></a>Reviewing Store Presence</h2>
Our review of your store presence typically takes 3-5 business days to complete, but you'll want to
submit your page for review at least 7 business days before you want it live to account for
potential changes you'll need to make. We'll send you any feedback if necessary, or if none is
necessary, we'll mark your store page as "Ready for release".<br />
<br />
Here's a list of things we check for when reviewing the store presence for your product:<br />
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong
            >Your store page should only contain features and content that will be available at
            launch</strong
        ><br />
        You will need to remove screenshots, trailers, or features listed that contain content that
        are incomplete or planned to be implemented. If you include content that's planned to be
        implemented later in your description section, it will need to be clear that the feature is
        currently not released. <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Your capsule images will need to include a readable product title or logo.</strong
        ><br />
        You can learn more about our guidelines in the
        <a href="/doc/store/assets">Graphical Assets - Overview</a> documentation.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Your screenshots must only contain gameplay.</strong> This means avoid using concept
        art, pre-rendered cinematic stills, or images that contain awards, marketing copy, or
        written product descriptions.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>The description will need to be detailed and coherent.</strong><br />
        It's important that customers know what to expect before they purchase your product. You
        should not include links to other websites from this section.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="4"></a>Reviewing Early Access Store Page</h2>
For titles that are releasing in Early Access, you will need to answer all the questions in the
Early Access section. In this section, you want to give customers a clear expectation of what the
current version of your game contains, and what features and content still need to be added before
the game is considered complete. You can view the
<a href="/doc/store/earlyaccess">Early Access</a> documentation for more information.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="5"></a>Reviewing Adult Content Store Page</h2>
For titles that have marked the "Adult Only Sexual Content" section in the Mature Content Survey,
both the Store Page and Product Build must be completed and submitted for review before the Store
Page will be reviewed and set to "Ready for release". Adult Content store pages and builds can take
longer than the typical 3-5 business days to review.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="6"></a>Reviewing Product Build</h2>
Our review of your game or software build prior to release typically takes 3-5 business days to
complete, but we ask that you plan for at least 7 business days to ensure that we are able to review
and approve in time for release and to allow for time in case an issue should arise. We'll send you
any feedback if necessary, or if none is necessary, we'll mark your product as "Ready for
release".<br />
<br />
Here's a list of things we check for when reviewing your product:<br />
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Your product will need to start up properly.</strong><br />
        This means that your product must successfully launch in all supported operating systems
        listed on the store page. <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong
            >All supported features listed on the store page will need to be implemented in the
            current build.</strong
        ><br />
        If you intend to add a feature in the future, you'll need to remove the selected feature in
        the Basic Info tab until it is implemented and released.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Your product must use Steam Wallet for any in-game transactions.</strong><br />
        This means that your product cannot link to other store pages that does not offer Steam
        Wallet.
    </li>
</ul>
<br />
You can continue to make updates and changes to your build after review and approval, but you should
be submitting a near-final build for review.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="7"></a>Reviewing Trading Cards</h2>
Our review of your trading cards typically takes 3-5 business days. Any necessary feedback will be
provided to you via the tool. Once all your trading card assets are uploaded, click the edit link
beneath “Release State” to configure your card drop settings and mark your assets as ready for
review. Once set as ready for review, your cards will automatically appear in our queue to review by
a Valve designer. <br />
<br />
After your assets are approved, you'll see the status update on your Steamworks home page. You’ll
then be able to set the release state to “Released” and publish the items. You can check our
<a href="/doc/marketing/tradingcards">Steam Trading Cards</a> documentation for more information.
